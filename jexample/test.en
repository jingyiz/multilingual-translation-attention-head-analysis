But it may be said to mark the point when the European Commission open@@ ly acknow@@ led@@ ged that it has become little more than a sec@@ ret@@ ari@@ at to EU government@@ s.
That is a far c@@ ry from the political power@@ house that some Europeans fear – and for which others still hop@@ e.
J@@ ust when the smo@@ ke from Turkey’s domestic political conflic@@ ts of the past year had be@@ gu@@ n to cle@@ ar, another de@@ adly attack by Kur@@ dis@@ h separ@@ ati@@ sts on Turkish soldi@@ ers has the government threat@@ ening military attacks in@@ side nor@@ thern Iraq.
That prospect rais@@ es risks for Turke@@ y, Iraq, and the United Stat@@ es.
But there are reasons to doubt that the situation is as dangerous as recent head@@ lines sug@@ ges@@ t.
Turkey acc@@ uses Iraqi Kur@@ ds of har@@ bor@@ ing between 3@@ ,000 and 3,@@ 500 of Turkey’s most active Kur@@ dis@@ h milit@@ ants – the P@@ K@@ K separ@@ ati@@ st gu@@ er@@ ill@@ as who are blam@@ ed for the death@@ s of 8@@ 0 Turkish soldi@@ ers so far this year.
The troub@@ le reached the bo@@ il@@ ing point on Oc@@ tober 7, when Kur@@ dis@@ h figh@@ ters killed 1@@ 3 Turkish soldi@@ ers near Turkey’s border with Iraq.
The Turkish public has de@@ man@@ ded ac@@ tion, and Prime Minister Rec@@ ep Ta@@ y@@ y@@ i@@ p Erdo@@ gan@@ ’s government has respon@@ ded.
On Oc@@ tober 1@@ 7, despite p@@ le@@ as for pati@@ ence and res@@ tra@@ int from Iraq and the US, Turkish law@@ makers voted 50@@ 7-@@ 1@@ 9 to authori@@ ze Erdo@@ g@@ an to order cros@@ s-@@ border military strik@@ es into Iraq at any time over the next year.
Erdo@@ g@@ an has sent Iraqi Kur@@ ds a forc@@ eful mes@@ sa@@ ge.
But, for several reason@@ s, the Turkish military is likely to limit its oper@@ ations to sm@@ all-@@ scale in@@ cur@@ sions and air strik@@ es on specific targe@@ ts rather than laun@@ ch an all-@@ out war.
First, the Turkish military has no interest in emb@@ rac@@ ing the risks that come with invol@@ vement in Iraq@@ ’s sec@@ t@@ arian stri@@ f@@ e.
A ful@@ l-@@ scale inv@@ asion might well provo@@ ke Iraq@@ ’s own Kur@@ dis@@ h gu@@ er@@ ri@@ ll@@ as into a pro@@ lon@@ ged and blo@@ od@@ y batt@@ le with Turkish forces that can only undermin@@ e support for Erdo@@ gan@@ ’s government at home and ab@@ road@@ .
Second, Turkey’s government hop@@ es to keep the country’s bi@@ d to join the European Union moving for@@ war@@ d.
An inv@@ asion of Iraq would bring that process to a gr@@ in@@ ding hal@@ t.
EU Foreign Poli@@ cy ch@@ ief J@@ a@@ vier Sol@@ an@@ a has made pla@@ in that Europe stron@@ gly op@@ poses any lar@@ ge-@@ scale Turkish military operation in Iraq.
Thir@@ d, Turkey is well aw@@ are that an all-@@ out attack in@@ side Iraq is exac@@ tly what Turkey’s Kur@@ dis@@ h separ@@ ati@@ sts wan@@ t.
What better way to damage Turkey than to pul@@ l its military into conflict with Iraq, the US, and the EU@@ ?
Erdo@@ g@@ an has no inten@@ tion of being draw@@ n into that tra@@ p@@ .
With all that in min@@ d, this latest move by Turkey’s parli@@ ament should be seen more as an ultim@@ at@@ um to Iraq@@ ’s Kur@@ dis@@ h Region@@ al Govern@@ ment to ex@@ pe@@ l the Turkish Kur@@ ds and an attempt to persu@@ ade the US to use its consider@@ able influence ther@@ e.
That@@ ’s har@@ d@@ ball politic@@ s, not a decl@@ ar@@ ation of war.
The parliamentary authori@@ zation itself is car@@ eful@@ ly wor@@ ded to under@@ line Turkey’s limited aim@@ s.
It st@@ res@@ ses that Turkey’s military has no inten@@ tion of occup@@ ying Iraqi terri@@ tory or threat@@ ening Iraqi Kur@@ ds or their oil infrastructu@@ re.
An attack would certainly make Iraq@@ ’s Kur@@ dis@@ h pro@@ vin@@ ces less appe@@ aling for foreign invest@@ or@@ s. But Turkey has no reason to attack the assets of foreign oil compani@@ es.
Iraq@@ ’s central government is aw@@ are of the risk@@ s, as well@@ , and is likely to exerc@@ ise ma@@ xim@@ um res@@ tra@@ in@@ t.
A limited Turkish stri@@ ke into nor@@ thern Iraq would probably e@@ lic@@ it little re@@ action beyond public condem@@ nation and rhet@@ ori@@ cal asser@@ tions of Iraqi sovereign@@ ty.
Th@@ re@@ ats to Iraq@@ ’s oil infrastructure around the nor@@ thern Iraqi city of Kir@@ ku@@ k and other terri@@ tory under the Kur@@ dis@@ h Region@@ al Govern@@ ment@@ ’s control are minim@@ al.
Turkey’s government knows that any move to sh@@ ut down the 60@@ 0-@@ m@@ ile pi@@ pel@@ ine from Kir@@ ku@@ k to Turkey’s Medi@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an port at C@@ ey@@ h@@ an would have little ne@@ ar-@@ term imp@@ ac@@ t, since most of Iraq@@ ’s oil exports f@@ low from the sou@@ th, hundreds of mil@@ es from the country’s border with Turke@@ y.
Fur@@ ther@@ mor@@ e, the Turkish military can increase the pressure on Iraqi Kur@@ ds with far less drasti@@ c meas@@ ur@@ es.
It can close the two countries’ princip@@ al border cros@@ s@@ ing, an important rou@@ te for fo@@ od, fuel@@ , and other goods he@@ aded for Iraqi Kur@@ ds.
It could also cut exports of electric@@ ity to nor@@ thern Iraq.
Still@@ , even sm@@ all-@@ scale military oper@@ ations would generate risk@@ .
If the P@@ K@@ K is able to laun@@ ch a major attack on troops or civili@@ ans in@@ side Turke@@ y, the public out@@ c@@ ry might leave Erdo@@ g@@ an with little choice but to up the an@@ te.
The issue is complic@@ ated further by Turkey’s ref@@ us@@ al to negoti@@ ate directly with the Kur@@ dis@@ h Region@@ al Govern@@ ment in nor@@ thern Iraq.
Such tal@@ k@@ s, Turkey fear@@ s, would offer tac@@ it acknow@@ led@@ gement that Iraqi Kur@@ ds have won a degree of autonom@@ y from B@@ ag@@ h@@ d@@ ad.
That@@ ’s a brid@@ ge too far for Turkey’s nation@@ alists and its milit@@ ary.
There are risks for Iraqi Prime Minister No@@ ur@@ i al M@@ ali@@ k@@ i as well@@ , because Turkish military strik@@ es on Iraq@@ ’s nor@@ thern pro@@ vin@@ ces could undermin@@ e the Kur@@ dis@@ h support on which his government increasingly depend@@ s.
Both Sun@@ ni Ara@@ bs and Kur@@ ds already res@@ ent al M@@ ali@@ k@@ i@@ ’s mil@@ d re@@ action to Iran’s recent sh@@ elling of Iraqi terri@@ tory – an attempt to stri@@ ke at Iranian Kur@@ dis@@ h milit@@ ants f@@ le@@ eing across its border with Iraq.
There are also risks for the US.
Most supp@@ lies he@@ aded for US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan move through the In@@ cir@@ li@@ k air@@ b@@ ase in Turke@@ y.
With the threat that the US Hous@@ e of Re@@ pres@@ ent@@ atives will appro@@ ve a res@@ olution that acc@@ uses Tur@@ ks of gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de against eth@@ ic Armen@@ i@@ ans n@@ ine decades ago, this is a particularly in@@ opport@@ un@@ e moment for the two countries to be at od@@ ds over Iraq.
But, wor@@ st-@@ case scenari@@ os asi@@ de, a Turkish inv@@ asion of nor@@ thern Iraq can only serve the interests of Turkey’s Kur@@ dis@@ h separ@@ ati@@ st@@ s.
That@@ ’s why co@@ ol@@ er head@@ s are likely to prev@@ ail@@ .
L@@ im@@ ited cros@@ s-@@ border oper@@ ations are increasingly lik@@ el@@ y. A war between Turkey and Iraqi Kur@@ ds is not.
As an Australi@@ an citiz@@ en, I voted in the recent federal election ther@@ e.
So did about 9@@ 5% of regi@@ ster@@ ed Australi@@ an vo@@ ters.
That fig@@ ure contra@@ sts mark@@ edly with elections in the United States, where the tur@@ n@@ out in the 2004 presidential election bar@@ ely exc@@ ee@@ ded 60@@ %.
In Con@@ gres@@ sion@@ al elections that fall in the middle of a presid@@ ent@@ ’s ter@@ m, usually fe@@ wer than 40% of eli@@ gi@@ ble Americans bo@@ ther to vo@@ te.
There is a reason why so many Australi@@ ans vo@@ te.
In the 19@@ 20@@ ’@@ s, when vo@@ ter tur@@ n@@ out fell below 60@@ %, parli@@ ament made vo@@ ting comp@@ ul@@ sor@@ y.
Since then, despite governments of v@@ ar@@ ying political comp@@ lexi@@ on@@ s, there has been no serious attempt to repe@@ al the law, which poll@@ s show is supported by about 7@@ 0% of the popul@@ ation.
Australi@@ ans who don’t vote receive a let@@ ter as@@ king wh@@ y.
Those without an accep@@ table exc@@ us@@ e, like ill@@ ness or tra@@ v@@ el ab@@ ro@@ ad, must pay a small fin@@ e, but the number fin@@ ed is less than 1% of eli@@ gi@@ ble vo@@ ters.
In practic@@ e, what is comp@@ ul@@ sor@@ y is not c@@ ast@@ ing a v@@ ali@@ d vo@@ te, but going to the poll@@ ing plac@@ e, having one’s name ch@@ eck@@ ed off@@ , and put@@ ting a bal@@ lot pap@@ er in the bo@@ x@@ .
The sec@@ rec@@ y of the bal@@ lot makes it impossible to prevent people wri@@ ting non@@ sense on their bal@@ lot pap@@ ers or leaving them bl@@ ank@@ .
While the percentage of inv@@ ali@@ d vo@@ tes is a little higher where vo@@ ting is comp@@ ul@@ sor@@ y, it comes no@@ where near off@@ set@@ ting the difference in vo@@ ter tur@@ n@@ out.
Com@@ pul@@ sor@@ y vo@@ ting is not uni@@ que to Australi@@ a.
Bel@@ gi@@ um and Argentin@@ a introduc@@ ed it ear@@ li@@ er, and it is practic@@ ed in many other countries, especially in Latin America, although both sanctions and en@@ forc@@ ement v@@ ary.
Because I was in the US at the time of the Australi@@ an elec@@ tion, I was under no comp@@ ul@@ sion to vo@@ te.
I had many reasons to hope for the defe@@ at of John Ho@@ war@@ d@@ ’s conservative government, but that do@@ es@@ n’t explain why I went to some troub@@ le to vo@@ te, since the lik@@ eli@@ hood that my vote would make any difference was min@@ is@@ cu@@ le (@@ and, predict@@ ab@@ ly, it did not@@ ).
When vo@@ ting is vol@@ un@@ tar@@ y, and the chance that the result will be determined by any single person@@ ’s vote is extrem@@ ely low@@ , even the sm@@ all@@ est cost – for example, the time it takes to stro@@ ll down to the poll@@ ing plac@@ e, wa@@ it in lin@@ e, and c@@ ast a bal@@ lot – is sufficient to make vo@@ ting seem ir@@ ration@@ al.
Yet if many people follow this line of reason@@ ing, and do not vo@@ te, a min@@ ority of the population can determin@@ e a country’s futu@@ re, leaving a dis@@ con@@ t@@ ented maj@@ or@@ ity.
Pol@@ and@@ ’s recent electoral history provides an examp@@ le.
In the 2005 national elec@@ tions, bar@@ ely 40% of those eli@@ gi@@ ble vo@@ ted, the low@@ est total since the adv@@ ent of free elections after the communist peri@@ od.
As a result, J@@ ar@@ os@@ law K@@ ac@@ zy@@ n@@ sk@@ i was able to become prime minister with the support of a coalition of parties that gain@@ ed a majority of se@@ ats in parliament@@ , despite recei@@ ving only six million vo@@ t@@ es, out of a total of 30 million eli@@ gi@@ ble vo@@ ters.
When K@@ ac@@ zy@@ n@@ sk@@ i was forced to go to the poll@@ s again only two years later, it became evi@@ dent that many of those who had not voted in 2005 were un@@ happ@@ y with the out@@ come.
Tur@@ n@@ out ro@@ se to nearly 5@@ 4@@ %, with the increase especially mark@@ ed among yo@@ ung@@ er and bet@@ ter@@ -@@ educ@@ ated vo@@ ters.
K@@ ac@@ zy@@ n@@ sk@@ i@@ ’s government suff@@ ered a heav@@ y defe@@ at.
If we don’t want a small min@@ ority to determin@@ e our government, we will favor a high tur@@ n@@ out.
Yet since our own vote makes such a tin@@ y contribu@@ tion to the out@@ come, each of us still faces the temp@@ tation to get a free ri@@ de, not bo@@ ther@@ ing to vote while hop@@ ing that enough other people will vote to keep democracy ro@@ b@@ ust and to elec@@ t a government that is respon@@ sive to the views of a majority of citiz@@ ens.
But there are many possible reasons for vo@@ t@@ ing.
Some people vote because they enjo@@ y it, and would have nothing better to do with the time sa@@ ved if they did not.
O@@ thers are mo@@ tiv@@ ated by a sense of civi@@ c d@@ ut@@ y that does not ass@@ ess the ration@@ ality of vo@@ ting in terms of the possible impact of one’s own bal@@ lo@@ t.
Sti@@ ll others might vote not because they imag@@ ine that they will determin@@ e the outcome of the elec@@ tion, but bec@@ aus@@ e, like fo@@ ot@@ ball f@@ ans, they want to che@@ er their te@@ am on.
They may vote because if they don@@ ’@@ t, they will be in no position to comp@@ la@@ in if they don’t like the government that is elec@@ ted.
O@@ r they may calcul@@ ate that while the chan@@ ces of their determin@@ ing the outcome are only one in several milli@@ on, the result is of such importance that even that tin@@ y chance is enough to out@@ wei@@ gh the min@@ or in@@ conven@@ i@@ ences of vo@@ t@@ ing.
If these consider@@ ations fail to get people to the poll@@ s, however, comp@@ ul@@ sor@@ y vo@@ ting is one way of over@@ coming the fre@@ e-@@ ri@@ der problem.
The small cost imposed on not vo@@ ting makes it rational for everyone to vote and at the same time establish@@ es a social nor@@ m of vo@@ t@@ ing.
Australi@@ ans want to be co@@ erc@@ ed into vo@@ t@@ ing.
They are happ@@ y to vo@@ te, know@@ ing that everyone el@@ se is vo@@ t@@ ing, to@@ o.
Coun@@ tries wor@@ ried about low vo@@ ter tur@@ n@@ out would do well to consider their comp@@ ul@@ sor@@ y model@@ .
PAR@@ I@@ S – Despite the global economic crisis, s@@ ales of lu@@ x@@ ury goods are sur@@ ging world@@ wi@@ de.
Wh@@ y?
While market@@ ing has contribut@@ ed to the ris@@ e, the lu@@ x@@ ury market@@ ’s ro@@ b@@ ust growth is actually roo@@ ted in bi@@ olog@@ y.
Dis@@ c@@ us@@ sions about the structure of human thought have long been domin@@ ated by the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment view that reality is com@@ posed of four el@@ em@@ ent@@ s: sp@@ ac@@ e, time, mat@@ ter, and energ@@ y.
But rec@@ ently, a fi@@ f@@ th el@@ em@@ ent, inform@@ ation, has ent@@ ered the deb@@ ate.
And inform@@ ation, it tur@@ ns out, is crucial to understanding the fundamental dri@@ vers of lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y-@@ goods consump@@ tion, and thus to predic@@ ting the lu@@ x@@ ury market@@ ’s future.
Li@@ ving organis@@ ms communic@@ ate, and the information that they exchange shap@@ es their re@@ ality.
While anim@@ als use col@@ or@@ ful disp@@ la@@ ys and complic@@ ated behavi@@ ors to sign@@ al f@@ it@@ ness and streng@@ th, hum@@ ans use lu@@ x@@ ury goods to demon@@ st@@ rate economic heal@@ th.
But, more than a sym@@ bol@@ , bu@@ ying lu@@ x@@ ury goods could indic@@ ate future succ@@ ess, owing to the sel@@ ec@@ tive advantage that show@@ ing off provi@@ d@@ es.
In natu@@ re, competi@@ tors per@@ form@@ , and the most comp@@ ell@@ ing, be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful spec@@ tac@@ le win@@ s.
For most anim@@ als, mal@@ es are the per@@ form@@ ers.
M@@ ale bir@@ ds, for example, often have b@@ righ@@ tly col@@ or@@ ed pl@@ u@@ ma@@ ge or in@@ tric@@ ate app@@ end@@ ag@@ es, such as the Australi@@ an ly@@ re@@ bir@@ d@@ ’s long tail@@ .
As a result, competitive disp@@ la@@ ys have been interpre@@ ted as a way to demon@@ st@@ rate f@@ it@@ ness to a potential mat@@ e.
A bir@@ d that survi@@ ves, despite in@@ conven@@ i@@ ent pl@@ u@@ ma@@ ge that slow@@ s it down or makes it visi@@ ble to pre@@ d@@ ator@@ s, must be f@@ it, and will likely si@@ re a health@@ y pro@@ gen@@ y.
Given that f@@ em@@ ales be@@ ar the physi@@ cal burden of off@@ spr@@ ing, an un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive appear@@ ance is more advan@@ ta@@ ge@@ ous – and thus more common – in natu@@ re.
But hum@@ ans are social cre@@ at@@ ures with no natural pre@@ d@@ ator@@ s, so f@@ em@@ ale competition is more widespread – and demon@@ st@@ rative performance and disp@@ la@@ y are more lik@@ el@@ y.
Indeed, while vis@@ ual mani@@ fest@@ ations of wealth are pre@@ valent for both gen@@ ders, wom@@ en’s appear@@ ance is frequ@@ ently more vi@@ vi@@ d (and more clo@@ sely sc@@ ru@@ t@@ ini@@ z@@ ed@@ ).
But effective disp@@ la@@ y is cost@@ ly.
Develop@@ ing comp@@ lex@@ , vi@@ b@@ rant pl@@ u@@ ma@@ ge demands significant energy and genetic resourc@@ es.
Gen@@ es are difficult to maintain@@ , requ@@ iring sub@@ t@@ le and energ@@ y-@@ inten@@ sive correc@@ ting proc@@ ess@@ es.
J@@ ust as wri@@ ting too fast can cause ty@@ po@@ graph@@ ical er@@ ror@@ s that gar@@ ble a tex@@ t, rapid changes to the gen@@ ome can undermin@@ e a speci@@ es’ integ@@ rit@@ y.
Likewise, purchas@@ ing lu@@ x@@ ury goods requires substantial financial resourc@@ es.
This cost dict@@ ates the disp@@ la@@ y’s competitive imp@@ ac@@ t.
In today’s inform@@ ation@@ -@@ based world, sel@@ ec@@ tion is effective only if a stri@@ king appear@@ ance is ob@@ tain@@ ed at a very high price – and that price is know@@ n.
For example, those who use co@@ s@@ me@@ tics known to be exp@@ ensive often seem health@@ ier@@ , more vi@@ bran@@ t, and more attrac@@ tive than those who do not.
This is not the result of effici@@ ency (the most effective co@@ s@@ me@@ tics frequ@@ ently become p@@ har@@ mac@@ eu@@ tical dru@@ g@@ s@@ ).
R@@ ath@@ er, it sign@@ als a li@@ fest@@ y@@ le that values the preser@@ v@@ ation of be@@ au@@ ty and you@@ th.
C@@ os@@ me@@ tic@@ s, like all lu@@ x@@ ury produc@@ ts, gain influence not from their produc@@ tion, or even their purchas@@ e, but from their visi@@ bilit@@ y.
Indeed, an exp@@ ensive it@@ em with no la@@ bel or identi@@ fying character@@ istic@@ s has less competitive impact than a recognized it@@ em or br@@ and.
For lu@@ x@@ ury goods to have any func@@ tion, society needs information about their co@@ st.
This has been true to v@@ ar@@ ying degre@@ es throughout history – sometimes resulting in price bub@@ bl@@ es.
F@@ al@@ se inform@@ ation, such as counter@@ f@@ eit good@@ s, je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes the competi@@ tion@@ -@@ based sel@@ ec@@ tion process.
A@@ ni@@ mals com@@ mon@@ ly use m@@ im@@ ic@@ ry to capit@@ alize on knowledge – or fear – of an@@ other@@ ’s streng@@ th.
By im@@ it@@ ating an anim@@ al with a well-@@ known protec@@ tive profi@@ le, a weak@@ er one may enjo@@ y sel@@ ec@@ tive benefits without the cost@@ s.
But m@@ im@@ ic@@ r@@ y’s success in nature depends on the rati@@ o of the origin@@ al to the er@@ satz@@ .
If there are too few of the origin@@ al, the prof@@ ile los@@ es its signific@@ ance, and its protec@@ tive value v@@ an@@ ish@@ es.
Similarly, no@@ body would disp@@ la@@ y a symbo@@ l of wealth if it were too com@@ mon@@ .
Th@@ er@@ e@@ for@@ e, ass@@ essing whether lu@@ x@@ ury goods will maintain their imp@@ ac@@ t, and thus their appe@@ al, requires monit@@ or@@ ing the extent of counter@@ f@@ ei@@ t@@ ing.
Given that lu@@ x@@ ury goods provide individuals with a competitive advan@@ ta@@ ge, higher lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y-@@ goods s@@ ales could indic@@ ate a b@@ righ@@ ter economic future for a country.
In a time of crisis, countries in which lu@@ x@@ ury goods play their sel@@ ec@@ tive role effectively are the saf@@ est be@@ ts for productive invest@@ ment.
At the end of this mon@@ th, J@@ am@@ es Wol@@ f@@ en@@ so@@ hn@@ ’s ten@@ -@@ year ten@@ ure as President of the World Bank comes to an end.
Th@@ ough much remains to be accompli@@ shed and con@@ soli@@ dat@@ ed, his achiev@@ ements as leader of the international development community are no@@ te@@ wor@@ thy and provide a strong found@@ ation upon which to buil@@ d.
Perhaps Wol@@ f@@ en@@ so@@ hn@@ ’s most important contribu@@ tion was to cl@@ ari@@ fy the Bank@@ ’s mission – to promote growth and er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate poverty in the developing world – while recogni@@ zing the massive scale of that task and the in@@ adequ@@ acy of previous approach@@ es.
At one time, it was thought that since developing countries had less capital than more developed countries, merely sup@@ pl@@ ying more capital would solve their problems.
Indeed, this view provided part of the ration@@ ale for the World Bank@@ : if a shor@@ tage of funds was the proble@@ m, clearly a Bank would have to be a key part of the solu@@ tion.
In the 198@@ 0’s, there was a s@@ wit@@ ch from projects to policies – structural adjust@@ ments, invol@@ ving trade liber@@ aliz@@ ation, privati@@ z@@ ation, and macroeconomic stabili@@ zation (@@ typ@@ ically foc@@ using on prices rather than employment or out@@ put@@ .)
But these policies pro@@ ved neither necessary nor sufficient for grow@@ th@@ ; the countries of East Asia, which followed different policies, achieved faster growth and were far more successful in poverty reduc@@ tion.
Un@@ der Wol@@ f@@ en@@ so@@ hn@@ ’s leader@@ ship, the Bank began to look for multi@@ fac@@ et@@ ed strategi@@ es, fra@@ m@@ ed by what he called a Com@@ preh@@ ensive Development Fra@@ me@@ work.
Many of the lin@@ ks were ob@@ vi@@ ous, but had been given in@@ sufficient atten@@ tion.
Im@@ pro@@ ved rural productivity or better market access would do little good if road@@ s and har@@ bor@@ s were lack@@ ing.
In a mal@@ ari@@ a-@@ in@@ fest@@ ed country, mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation programs can boost production and even increase effective land us@@ age, as ac@@ res that were almost un@@ in@@ hab@@ it@@ able become li@@ v@@ able.
The retur@@ ns from education, too, can be increas@@ ed, if more individuals live longer because of better health car@@ e.
The Bank began to recognize that developing countries differ@@ ed from more developed countries not just in their lack of resourc@@ es; there was also a knowledge g@@ ap@@ .
This was particularly important as the world mo@@ ved into what we call the “@@ knowledge econom@@ y@@ .”
Am@@ ong the success st@@ ories were India and East Asia, which invest@@ ed heav@@ ily not just in primary education, but also in sec@@ on@@ dar@@ y and ter@@ ti@@ ary education, and especially in technology and sci@@ ence.
This repres@@ ented a major change in the Bank@@ ’s approach to education, which pre@@ viously focused on primary school@@ ing .
Wol@@ f@@ en@@ so@@ hn@@ ’s campaign against corruption also repres@@ ented a major change in think@@ ing, a shift from down@@ si@@ zing the state to impro@@ ving the Stat@@ e.
F@@ ail@@ ed states, it was now acknow@@ led@@ ge@@ d, were no less an im@@ pe@@ di@@ ment to development than were over@@ be@@ aring states.
The Bank@@ ’s 199@@ 7 World Development Re@@ port reflec@@ ted this new attempt at fin@@ ding a bal@@ anced role for the state, and show@@ ed an understanding of the limit@@ ations both of markets and government.
Un@@ der Wol@@ f@@ en@@ so@@ h@@ n, the Bank repe@@ at@@ edly stood up to the United States, where both the Clinton and Bush administ@@ ra@@ tions might have prefer@@ red a more p@@ li@@ ant Pres@@ id@@ ent.
When then US Dep@@ ut@@ y Secretary of the Treasury L@@ aw@@ ren@@ ce Sum@@ m@@ ers tried to change the Bank@@ ’s Dec@@ en@@ ni@@ al report on poverty – to down@@ gra@@ de concerns about in@@ security and em@@ power@@ ment and to focus more nar@@ row@@ ly on income – the Bank prev@@ ai@@ led.
When the US tried to sup@@ press the Bank@@ ’s call for a more bal@@ anced intellectual property regime – one more con@@ son@@ ant with the interests of developing countries – the Bank prev@@ ail@@ ed yet again@@ .
Both the Bush administration and the EU would und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly have prefer@@ red less critic@@ ism of their trade regi@@ m@@ es, which have such ad@@ verse effects on developing countries.
It would have been help@@ ful for Bush if the World Bank qui@@ et@@ ly accepted propos@@ als to finance debt re@@ lief for the poorest countries by dep@@ le@@ ting its reser@@ ves, thereby making poor countries pay for the poorest by reducing the Bank@@ ’s lending capac@@ ity.
But it would have been wron@@ g, and the Bank again stood up for the interests of the developing world.
Ch@@ ang@@ ing the relationship between the Bank and the countries seeking its help was no less of an achiev@@ em@@ ent.
In the past@@ , the Bank was seen as a pur@@ ve@@ y@@ or of ne@@ oli@@ ber@@ al or@@ thodo@@ x@@ y – an approach to development whose credi@@ bility had weak@@ ened by the time Wol@@ f@@ en@@ so@@ h@@ n ar@@ ri@@ v@@ ed, and whose standing has ero@@ ded further sin@@ ce.
That or@@ thodo@@ x@@ y often went hand in hand with the nation@@ al, corpor@@ ate, and financial interests of the advanced industrial countries, or so it was percei@@ v@@ ed.
Wor@@ se, the Bank typ@@ ically de@@ man@@ ded my@@ ri@@ ad conditions in return for assi@@ st@@ ance, an approach that undermin@@ ed democratic proc@@ esses and domestic owner@@ ship of policies, thereby en@@ er@@ v@@ ating their effec@@ tiven@@ ess.
When Bank research show@@ ed that condi@@ tion@@ ality did not work, the Bank under Wol@@ f@@ en@@ so@@ h@@ n mo@@ ved away from it.
The Bank began to re@@ alize that on many key issues there were legitimate dis@@ agreements among economists about the right course of ac@@ tion.
Democ@@ ra@@ cy requires active debate about economic policies, not the sup@@ pression of discus@@ sion or the del@@ eg@@ ation of decision@@ -@@ making to exper@@ ts, whether domestic or for@@ eig@@ n.
The Bank@@ ’s attempt to open the debate was not well recei@@ v@@ ed, by either the US Treasury or the IMF@@ , but its influence was unden@@ i@@ able.
The Fund@@ , too, began to reduce condi@@ tion@@ ality, and eventually it began to question the desi@@ ra@@ bility of capital market liber@@ aliz@@ ation, which pre@@ viously had been central to its agenda@@ .
Gra@@ du@@ ally the Bank came to be percei@@ v@@ ed, at least in many quar@@ ters, as a partn@@ er in the jo@@ int qu@@ est for growth and poverty reduc@@ tion, not an ad@@ vers@@ ary attemp@@ ting to promote a Western economic agenda or ide@@ olog@@ y.
Wol@@ f@@ en@@ so@@ h@@ n meant it when he said that he wanted to put the country in the dri@@ ver@@ ’s se@@ at, though not everyone within the Bank was as enth@@ usi@@ as@@ tic about this (or some of his other@@ ) initi@@ ativ@@ es.
J@@ am@@ es Wol@@ f@@ en@@ so@@ h@@ n pres@@ ided over the World Bank at a time of enormous change, t@@ um@@ ul@@ t, and opport@@ un@@ ity, an era mark@@ ed by the end of the Cold W@@ ar, the post@@ communist transition to market economies, and the East Asian – and then global – financial cri@@ ses.
His commitment to those in the developing world has been con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ous.
He has left an im@@ pres@@ sive leg@@ acy for his success@@ or to take up@@ .
NEW YORK – We are just recover@@ ing, in the United States, from the entirely predict@@ able k@@ er@@ fu@@ ff@@ le over a pla@@ int publi@@ shed by An@@ ne@@ -@@ Mar@@ ie S@@ lau@@ gh@@ ter, former Di@@ rec@@ tor of Poli@@ cy Plan@@ ning at the State De@@ part@@ ment and a prof@@ ess@@ or at P@@ r@@ inc@@ et@@ on Universi@@ ty, called “@@ Why W@@ om@@ en Sti@@ ll Can@@ ’t Ha@@ ve it All@@ .”
The response was predict@@ able because S@@ lau@@ gh@@ ter@@ ’s ar@@ tic@@ le is one that is publi@@ shed in the US by a re@@ vol@@ ving c@@ ast of powerful (@@ most often wh@@ it@@ e) women every three years or so.
The arti@@ cle@@ , wh@@ o@@ ever has w@@ ritten it, always be@@ mo@@ ans the “@@ my@@ th@@ ” of a work@@ -@@ life balance for women who work outside the hom@@ e, pres@@ ents the gl@@ ass c@@ ei@@ ling and work@@ -@@ family ex@@ haus@@ tion as a personal re@@ vel@@ ation, and blam@@ es “@@ f@@ emin@@ ism@@ ” for holding out this el@@ u@@ sive “@@ ha@@ v@@ ing-@@ it@@ -@@ all ide@@ al@@ .”
And it always man@@ ages to ev@@ ade the major policy el@@ ep@@ h@@ ants in the ro@@ om – which is especially ir@@ on@@ ic in this case, as S@@ lau@@ gh@@ ter was wor@@ n out by cra@@ f@@ ting policy.
The problems with such argum@@ ents are man@@ y.
For star@@ ters, the work@@ -@@ family balance is no longer a wom@@ en’s issu@@ e.
All over the developed world, millions of working men with small children also re@@ gre@@ t the ho@@ urs that they spend away from them, and go home to be@@ ar the br@@ un@@ t of shared domestic t@@ as@@ k@@ s.
This was a “@@ wom@@ en’s issu@@ e” 15 years ago, perh@@ ap@@ s, but now it is an ambi@@ ent ten@@ sion of modern life for a generation of women and men who are committed to gender equ@@ ality.
Such argum@@ ents also ignor@@ e the fact that aff@@ lu@@ ent working women and their partn@@ ers overwhelm@@ ingly off@@ lo@@ ad the work@@ -@@ family im@@ balance on@@ to lower@@ -@@ income women – overwhelm@@ ingly women of col@@ or.
One can address how to be an eth@@ ic@@ al, sustainable employ@@ er of such car@@ egi@@ vers@@ ; n@@ anni@@ es in New York and other cities are now organiz@@ ing to secure a system of market@@ -@@ pe@@ g@@ ged w@@ ag@@ es, v@@ ac@@ ation time, and si@@ ck da@@ y@@ s.
Or@@ , as so often happ@@ ens in a rac@@ ist societ@@ y, one can pain@@ t the women who care for the eli@@ te@@ ’s children out of the p@@ ic@@ ture al@@ toge@@ ther.
Moreover, an inf@@ lexi@@ ble and fam@@ il@@ y-@@ un@@ friend@@ ly corporate environment is no longer the only choice for working wom@@ en.
Man@@ y, particularly in the US, have left that world to start their own business@@ es.
Most importantly, Americans have a remark@@ able tenden@@ cy to reduce problems that others addres@@ sed through public policy to a matter of private “@@ choic@@ e” and even personal psych@@ olog@@ y.
But the real question is not whether “@@ women can have it all@@ .”
R@@ ath@@ er, it is how a s@@ op@@ h@@ istic@@ ated foreign-@@ policy profession@@ al can wri@@ te as if countries like Can@@ ada and the Ne@@ ther@@ lands simply did not ex@@ ist.
In Can@@ ad@@ a, cou@@ ples with a bab@@ y may sequ@@ ence si@@ x@@ -@@ month lea@@ ves of absence at up to 9@@ 0% pa@@ y.
In the Ne@@ ther@@ lands – the best scenari@@ o I have seen yet – famili@@ es can take a day off each week@@ , and the government subsi@@ di@@ zes ful@@ l-@@ time da@@ y@@ car@@ e.
This solution was not fra@@ m@@ ed as a “@@ wom@@ en’s issu@@ e@@ ,” but as a family benef@@ it.
And D@@ ut@@ ch women have simply mo@@ ved on, foc@@ using on other interest@@ ing go@@ als in their personal and family li@@ ves.
In America, by contrast, the Ch@@ am@@ ber of Com@@ mer@@ ce and other business interests lob@@ by hard to keep politicians from ever propos@@ ing such solu@@ tions.
They know that billi@@ ons of dollars are made from h@@ iring women at lower income levels than men, and then ens@@ uring that a work@@ -@@ family conflict der@@ ail@@ s wom@@ en’s car@@ e@@ ers before they become too exp@@ ensive to compens@@ ate fair@@ ly.
Of course, Europe is not gen@@ der@@ -@@ equ@@ ality N@@ ir@@ v@@ an@@ a.
In particul@@ ar, the corporate work@@ place will never be comple@@ tel@@ y fam@@ il@@ y-@@ friend@@ ly until women are part of senior management decision@@ s, and Europe’s top corpor@@ ate-@@ governance posi@@ tions remain overwhelm@@ ingly mal@@ e.
Indeed, women hold only 1@@ 4% of posi@@ tions on European corporate bo@@ ard@@ s.
The European Union is now consider@@ ing legisl@@ ation to compe@@ l corporate bo@@ ards to maintain a certain propor@@ tion of women – up to 60@@ %.
This proposed mand@@ ate was born of fru@@ stra@@ tion.
Last year, European Commission Vi@@ ce President Vi@@ vi@@ an@@ e R@@ ed@@ ing issu@@ ed a call to vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary ac@@ tion.
R@@ ed@@ ing inv@@ ited corpor@@ ations to sign up for gender balance go@@ als of 40% f@@ em@@ ale bo@@ ard member@@ ship.
The For@@ te found@@ ation in America has now followed su@@ it with its own list of “@@ bo@@ ard@@ -@@ ready wom@@ en@@ .”
But R@@ ed@@ ing@@ ’s appe@@ al in Europe was considered a fail@@ u@@ re@@ : only 2@@ 4 companies took it up@@ .
D@@ o we need quo@@ t@@ as to ensure that women can continue to clim@@ b the corporate lad@@ der fair@@ ly as they balance work and fam@@ il@@ y?
“@@ Person@@ ally, I don’t like quo@@ t@@ as@@ ,” R@@ ed@@ ing said rec@@ ent@@ ly.
“@@ But I like what the quo@@ t@@ as do@@ .”
Qu@@ ot@@ as get ac@@ tion@@ : they “@@ open the way to equ@@ ality and they break through the gl@@ ass c@@ ei@@ ling@@ ,” according to R@@ ed@@ ing, a result seen in France and other countries with leg@@ ally bin@@ ding provi@@ sions on plac@@ ing women in top business posi@@ tions.
I understand R@@ ed@@ ing@@ ’s re@@ tic@@ ence – and her fru@@ stra@@ tion.
I don’t like quo@@ t@@ as ei@@ ther@@ ; they run coun@@ ter to my belief in mer@@ it@@ oc@@ rac@@ y.
But, when one consi@@ ders the ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les to achiev@@ ing the mer@@ it@@ oc@@ ratic ide@@ al, it does look as if a fair@@ er world must be tempor@@ arily mand@@ ated.
After all, four decades of evidence has now shown that corpor@@ ations in Europe as well as the US are ev@@ ad@@ ing the mer@@ it@@ oc@@ ratic h@@ iring and promo@@ tion of women to top posi@@ tions – no matter how much “@@ soft pressu@@ re@@ ” is put upon them.
When women do break through to the summit of corporate power – as, for example, S@@ her@@ y@@ l S@@ and@@ ber@@ g recently did at Fac@@ eb@@ o@@ ok – they gar@@ ner massive attention precisely because they remain the excep@@ tion to the ru@@ le.
If appropriate public policies were in place to help all women – whether CE@@ O@@ s or their chil@@ d@@ ren@@ ’s car@@ egi@@ vers – and all famili@@ es, S@@ and@@ ber@@ g would be no more new@@ s@@ wor@@ thy than any other highly capable person living in a more just society.
And lam@@ ents like S@@ lau@@ gh@@ ter@@ ’s would not be necess@@ ary.
S@@ I@@ NG@@ A@@ P@@ OR@@ E – The latest information d@@ um@@ p from W@@ ik@@ i@@ Le@@ ak@@ s offers fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating insi@@ gh@@ ts into the work@@ ings of the US State De@@ part@@ ment that will keep foreign policy won@@ ks and con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cy the@@ or@@ ists bus@@ y for month@@ s.
Mu@@ ch of what has been repor@@ ted is not “@@ new@@ s” in the traditional sen@@ se, of course, but a seri@@ es of em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ sing g@@ aff@@ es: tru@@ th@@ s that were never meant to be said al@@ ou@@ d.
Un@@ der@@ lying these vari@@ ous, and often ban@@ al, ti@@ d@@ b@@ its of information – it should be no surpri@@ se that Americans found Itali@@ an Prime Minister S@@ il@@ vi@@ o Berluscon@@ i “@@ v@@ ain@@ ,” or regar@@ ded Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we@@ ’s Robert Mu@@ gabe as a “@@ cra@@ z@@ y old man@@ ” – is the larger question of whether governments should be able to keep secre@@ ts.
W@@ ik@@ i@@ Le@@ ak@@ s fo@@ under Ju@@ li@@ an As@@ s@@ ange argu@@ es that the answer is no@@ , and that greater transpar@@ ency “@@ cre@@ ates a better society for all peop@@ le@@ .”
This rais@@ es the question of why governments keep secre@@ ts at all, and whether those reasons are justi@@ fi@@ ed.
The task of ke@@ eping a stat@@ e’s secre@@ ts frequ@@ ently falls to its intel@@ ligence servic@@ es, which tend to focus on the protection of three typ@@ es of inform@@ ation.
The first type is their own sources and metho@@ ds, which need to be saf@@ eg@@ u@@ ar@@ ded if they are to remain effective when ga@@ ther@@ ing dat@@ a.
When the Washington Tim@@ es repor@@ ted in 1998 that the National Security Agen@@ cy was able to monit@@ or O@@ sam@@ a bin L@@ ad@@ en’s sat@@ el@@ li@@ te ph@@ one, for example, he stopp@@ ed using it.
Second, the identi@@ ties and activi@@ ties of a servic@@ e’s oper@@ ational st@@ af@@ f should be with@@ hel@@ d, so that they can do their jobs and to ensure their saf@@ et@@ y.
Fol@@ low@@ ing W@@ ik@@ i@@ Le@@ ak@@ s’ re@@ le@@ ase in Ju@@ ly of tens of thousands of docum@@ ents on the Afgh@@ an war, a Taliban spo@@ k@@ es@@ man told British journ@@ alists that the group was “@@ stud@@ ying the re@@ port@@ ” with a view to identi@@ fying and pun@@ ish@@ ing anyone found to have coll@@ abor@@ ated with US forc@@ es.
Thir@@ d, information provided in confidence by foreign governments or intel@@ ligence services must be clo@@ sely held to avoid em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ sing the provi@@ der of the information and thereby reducing the lik@@ eli@@ hood that information will be shared in future.
A la@@ sting consequ@@ ence of the most recent lea@@ k is circum@@ spec@@ tion when shar@@ ing intel@@ ligence with the United Stat@@ es.
In re@@ ality, of course, governments typ@@ ically attempt to keep much more than this secre@@ t.
A@@ vo@@ iding em@@ bar@@ ra@@ ss@@ ment may at times be in the national interes@@ t, but it can also protect the car@@ e@@ ers of politicians and bureauc@@ rat@@ s. In other circum@@ st@@ ances, it may be p@@ ru@@ dent to avoid reve@@ aling how much – or how little – is known about a given situ@@ ation.
W@@ ik@@ i@@ Le@@ ak@@ s se@@ es itself as part of the tradi@@ tion in which the media hold governments accoun@@ table for ab@@ us@@ e.
The role of the F@@ our@@ th E@@ state was particularly important during the administration of President George W Bush@@ .
Re@@ vel@@ ations of tor@@ tu@@ re, extra@@ ordinary ren@@ di@@ tion, and war@@ ran@@ t@@ less elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic surv@@ ei@@ ll@@ ance all depen@@ ded on investig@@ ative journ@@ alism of a kind that is now threat@@ ened by budget cuts and the medi@@ a’s rel@@ ent@@ less focus on whatever is current – often at the exp@@ ense of what is genu@@ in@@ ely new@@ s@@ wor@@ th@@ y.
But, whereas true investig@@ ative journ@@ alism depends on qu@@ ality, W@@ ik@@ i@@ Le@@ ak@@ s dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ish@@ es itself by quanti@@ ty.
The she@@ er volum@@ e of the data being d@@ ump@@ ed on the Internet makes it impossible for th@@ or@@ ough analysi@@ s or, indeed, for th@@ or@@ ough exam@@ in@@ ation of potentially dam@@ aging inform@@ ation.
The th@@ res@@ hold for ex@@ pos@@ ure is no longer wron@@ g@@ doing of the scale that co@@ ined the term “@@ W@@ at@@ erg@@ at@@ e” and all the sub@@ sequ@@ ent “@@ -@@ g@@ at@@ es@@ .”
Instead, government officials are being war@@ ned that every docum@@ ent may potentially be le@@ ak@@ ed and publi@@ shed worldwide by a dis@@ gr@@ un@@ t@@ led j@@ uni@@ or offic@@ er.
The consequ@@ ence is unlikely to be transpar@@ enc@@ y.
Per@@ ver@@ sel@@ y, it will lead to greater sec@@ rec@@ y.
The message that is almost certainly going through every major power is@@ : be car@@ eful what you com@@ mit to w@@ rit@@ ing.
In place of can@@ did ass@@ ess@@ ments and pro@@ voc@@ ative analysi@@ s, many important decisions will now be based on or@@ al bri@@ ef@@ ings and me@@ et@@ ings that are not rec@@ or@@ ded in min@@ ut@@ es.
D@@ eci@@ sion@@ -@@ makers will be war@@ y of op@@ enn@@ ess even with their clos@@ est st@@ aff@@ .
These changes are likely to out@@ last US Secretary of State H@@ ill@@ ary Clint@@ on’s em@@ bar@@ ra@@ ss@@ ment.
Such self-@@ c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship will lead to worse decisions and less account@@ ability for the decisions that are ma@@ de.
It seems a high price to pay for go@@ ssi@@ p@@ .
PAR@@ I@@ S – Be@@ yond the head@@ lin@@ es, the em@@ bar@@ ra@@ ss@@ ment of government@@ s, and the b@@ low de@@ alt to the sec@@ rec@@ y of diplomatic cor@@ respon@@ den@@ ce, W@@ ik@@ i@@ Le@@ ak@@ s’ ex@@ pos@@ ure of US diplomatic c@@ ab@@ les offers a ra@@ w illu@@ stration of how deeply the essen@@ ce of power has been al@@ tered in our information age.
Since its inc@@ ep@@ tion, the state has been the main v@@ es@@ sel of power@@ ; access to power usually meant control of the state, whether by election or by violent tak@@ e@@ over@@ .
This model@@ , within which individuals are sub@@ jec@@ ts or, at bes@@ t, taxpay@@ ers and vo@@ ters, is being undermin@@ ed by several recent tren@@ ds that have em@@ power@@ ed the individu@@ al.
Consider the Inter@@ net, a net@@ work of connec@@ ted no@@ des inv@@ ented in the 1960@@ ’@@ s, at the hei@@ ght of the Cold W@@ ar, to preser@@ ve the United States from total cha@@ os after a nuclear attack on its ner@@ ve cent@@ ers.
It was de@@ liber@@ ately construc@@ ted with no hier@@ arch@@ y, no cor@@ e, and no central author@@ ity, though few at the time could have susp@@ ec@@ ted wher@@ e, given the num@@ er@@ ous break@@ through@@ s of the dig@@ it@@ al revolu@@ tion, the Intern@@ et@@ ’s buil@@ t-@@ in tren@@ d toward de@@ cent@@ rali@@ zed power would lead@@ .
It has led to the second tren@@ d@@ : a met@@ am@@ or@@ p@@ ho@@ sis of the production process.
Inform@@ ation has become much more than a message con@@ ve@@ yed by technolog@@ y; it is now the ra@@ w materi@@ al of servic@@ es@@ -@@ inten@@ sive advanced economies, and the building blo@@ ck of modern social and productive organiz@@ ations.
The third tren@@ d concerns the ro@@ om this has op@@ ened for individual and collective ac@@ tion.
In The Hum@@ an Con@@ di@@ tion, the philosop@@ her H@@ ann@@ ah Ar@@ end@@ t lin@@ ked politics to the human capacity not simply to ac@@ t, but to “@@ act in conc@@ er@@ t@@ .”
While conc@@ er@@ ted action is a famili@@ ar no@@ tion, it used to be aimed mainly at influ@@ enc@@ ing the state – ex@@ emp@@ li@@ fied by the way civil society pro@@ mp@@ ted America’s withdraw@@ al from Vietnam@@ .
Today, however, collective action is of a different mag@@ nit@@ u@@ de.
Because of the univers@@ ality of the dig@@ it@@ al langu@@ age, its e@@ ase of us@@ e, and the vir@@ tual absence of margin@@ al costs for produc@@ ing or dis@@ sem@@ in@@ ating inform@@ ation, the stat@@ e’s tool@@ s of control have been weak@@ ened and dep@@ le@@ ted.
Global finance has been one of the most e@@ ager ben@@ e@@ fici@@ aries of these tren@@ ds, using Internet net@@ works not just as a to@@ ol to conduc@@ t oper@@ ations with greater effici@@ ency and vel@@ oc@@ ity, but also as a means to circum@@ v@@ ent state super@@ vi@@ sion.
Cor@@ por@@ ations have d@@ well@@ ed on connec@@ tivity to glob@@ alize their markets, R@@ &amp@@ ;@@ D@@ , owner@@ ship, tax dom@@ ici@@ li@@ ation, and leader@@ ship, th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly transform@@ ing their relationship with states, whether in their country of orig@@ in or elsewher@@ e.
In September 199@@ 2, it took George Sor@@ os $@@ 10 billion to bring the Bank of Eng@@ land to its k@@ ne@@ es and impose de@@ valu@@ ation on the po@@ und@@ .
It now takes only a compu@@ ter and Internet connec@@ tion to cause serious troub@@ le@@ : in@@ tru@@ sion by h@@ ack@@ ers into protec@@ ted net@@ work@@ s, or the introduc@@ tion of ha@@ voc@@ -@@ w@@ re@@ aking so@@ ft@@ w@@ are vi@@ rus@@ es and wor@@ ms in sensi@@ tive information system@@ s.
While the terrorist attacks of September 1@@ 1, 2001 – the de@@ ad@@ li@@ est of all time – had nothing “@@ vir@@ tu@@ al@@ ” about them, their per@@ pet@@ rat@@ or, al-@@ Qaed@@ a, projects a cl@@ oud of threat and power by using cy@@ ber@@ space to promote its blo@@ od@@ y “@@ success@@ es@@ ,” spread hat@@ re@@ d, and rec@@ ru@@ it ji@@ ha@@ dist@@ s.
Of course, access to a net@@ worked world has also bal@@ anced state power in positive way@@ s, by giving a form@@ id@@ able boost to independent advoc@@ ac@@ y, as seen in the on@@ line campaign to ban land@@ min@@ es and the treaty that rati@@ fied its success – despite opposition by powerful states.
Many similar organizations have fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ed, gain@@ ing the ability to shap@@ e political out@@ comes and public policies.
But there is no place where the transform@@ ative power of connec@@ tivity is potentially greater than in China, with its repor@@ ted 4@@ 20 million Internet us@@ ers.
No matter how e@@ ager China’s authorities are to keep the Internet under their control – for example, by block@@ ing foreign W@@ eb si@@ tes – they are also aw@@ are of how much their economy now needs the Intern@@ et.
As a result, the ro@@ om for “@@ conc@@ er@@ ted ac@@ tion@@ ” has never been so large for individual Chinese to gain access to unc@@ ens@@ or@@ ed inform@@ ation, share opini@@ on@@ s, and communic@@ ate countr@@ y-@@ wide to ex@@ pose official mis@@ conduc@@ t.
The Nobel Pe@@ ace Pri@@ ze lau@@ re@@ ate Li@@ u X@@ ia@@ ob@@ o was j@@ ail@@ ed for cir@@ cul@@ ating on the Internet his proposal for a truly democratic constitu@@ tion, Char@@ ter 0@@ 8, which ga@@ ther@@ ed 10@@ ,000 sig@@ nat@@ ures on@@ line in only 2@@ 4 ho@@ ur@@ s.
In the late 198@@ 0’s, g@@ las@@ no@@ st – transpar@@ ency – was one of the n@@ ail@@ s in the co@@ ff@@ in of the Soviet Union.
While W@@ ik@@ i@@ Le@@ ak@@ s has certainly not had a similar effec@@ t, it ep@@ it@@ om@@ iz@@ es the extent of the individu@@ al@@ ’s em@@ power@@ ment in a net@@ worked world.
All that was necessary to challenge the world’s m@@ igh@@ ti@@ est power, after all, was a dis@@ gr@@ un@@ t@@ led US Ar@@ my intel@@ ligence analy@@ st, some h@@ ack@@ ing know@@ led@@ ge, a few compu@@ ters, and a hand@@ ful of determined activi@@ sts en@@ ro@@ ll@@ ed under the con@@ test@@ ed b@@ ann@@ er of transpar@@ enc@@ y.
At the time she was nam@@ ed Di@@ rec@@ tor of Poli@@ cy Plan@@ ning at the US State De@@ part@@ ment, An@@ ne@@ -@@ Mar@@ ie S@@ lau@@ gh@@ ter, a respec@@ ted sch@@ ol@@ ar of international affair@@ s, b@@ old@@ ly her@@ al@@ ded the adv@@ ent of a net@@ worked world. “@@ W@@ ar, diplom@@ ac@@ y, bus@@ ines@@ s, medi@@ a, societ@@ y@@ …@@ are net@@ work@@ ed@@ ,” she w@@ ro@@ te in Foreign A@@ ff@@ air@@ s in Janu@@ ary 2009, and “@@ in this world, the measure of power is connec@@ ted@@ n@@ ess@@ .”
Ha@@ ving the greatest potential for connec@@ tiv@@ ity, America has the ed@@ ge in a “@@ net@@ worked centur@@ y@@ .”
This drive pro@@ mp@@ ted US Secretary of State H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton in Janu@@ ary 2010 to proc@@ la@@ im the “@@ freedom to connec@@ t” as the cy@@ ber@@ -@@ equi@@ valent of the more famili@@ ar freedom@@ s of ass@@ em@@ bly or ex@@ pres@@ sion.
Of course, Clinton ad@@ ded, these technologies are not an un@@ mi@@ tig@@ ated bl@@ ess@@ ing, and can be mis@@ used for d@@ ark@@ er pur@@ pos@@ es.
But her list of the potential ab@@ uses of the connec@@ ted world contain@@ ed nothing similar to the W@@ ik@@ i@@ Le@@ ak@@ s stor@@ m.
That stor@@ m will leave behind no tra@@ ce of understanding if it is ass@@ essed in isol@@ ation, rather than as part of a broader pat@@ tern.
W@@ ik@@ i@@ Le@@ ak@@ s’ latest re@@ le@@ ase demonstrat@@ es that the transform@@ ation of power by the “@@ dig@@ it@@ al revolution@@ ” could be as f@@ ar-@@ reach@@ ing as that brought about by the fi@@ f@@ te@@ enth@@ -@@ century prin@@ ting revolu@@ tion.
In this gam@@ e, where new play@@ ers inv@@ ite themsel@@ ves, the ed@@ ge goes to a@@ gi@@ lity and innov@@ ation.
All of this implies that connec@@ ted@@ ness will remain a dou@@ ble@@ -@@ ed@@ ged s@@ wor@@ d – the lever@@ age it provides being f@@ rau@@ ght with vulner@@ ability.
And that means that we can coun@@ t on more surpri@@ ses in stor@@ e for states.
Most people do not feel the same imp@@ ul@@ se to go out and buy insur@@ ance, or diversi@@ fy their invest@@ ments, as they do to buy a so@@ f@@ a or new clo@@ th@@ es.
They sh@@ oul@@ d, but they don@@ '@@ t.
In@@ sur@@ ance, invest@@ ment, and banking institutions have histor@@ ically had to fight an up@@ h@@ ill batt@@ le to get individu@@ als, business@@ es, and government to pay for risk manage@@ ment.
Their success@@ es, while im@@ pres@@ si@@ ve, remain in@@ comple@@ te: people still have difficul@@ ty facing the inher@@ ent risks and uncertain@@ ties about their economic future.
This is why almost every advanced country has mand@@ atory social security and health insurance program@@ s.
Of course, people are not really un@@ aw@@ are of life@@ 's big risk@@ s.
We simply ignor@@ e them for reasons that are roo@@ ted in human psych@@ olog@@ y.
The lin@@ k between intellectual recogni@@ tion of risks and the imp@@ et@@ us to act against them is medi@@ ated by fear@@ : we have been progra@@ mm@@ ed over millions of years of ev@@ olution to take deci@@ sive action against immediate and obvious threat@@ s.
If a men@@ ac@@ ing wi@@ ld anim@@ al approach@@ es, we feel fear and an@@ xi@@ et@@ y.
Ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine flow@@ s, our attention is foc@@ uss@@ ed, and our in@@ stinc@@ t to protect fri@@ ends and family ar@@ ous@@ ed.
But more remo@@ te risks simply do not stimul@@ ate our emo@@ tions, so we often post@@ p@@ one taking action in@@ defin@@ it@@ el@@ y.
We are also more af@@ ra@@ id of well-@@ publi@@ ci@@ zed risks - especially those that can k@@ ill us in g@@ ris@@ ly way@@ s.
After the September 1@@ 1, 2001, terrorist attacks in the US, many Americans dro@@ ve to dist@@ ant loc@@ ations rather than fl@@ y, even though statisti@@ cs show@@ ed that fl@@ ying remained far saf@@ er.
Meanwhile, many of these same people were probably among the millions of Americans who did@@ n@@ 't get an annual medical ch@@ eck@@ -@@ up@@ .
Me@@ as@@ uring risk@@ s, especially important long-term on@@ es, is imp@@ rec@@ ise and difficul@@ t.
V@@ ir@@ tually n@@ one of the economic statisti@@ cs repor@@ ted in the media measure risk@@ .
To fully compreh@@ end ris@@ k, we must stre@@ t@@ ch our imag@@ in@@ ation to think of all the different ways that things can go wron@@ g, including things that have not happened in recent mem@@ or@@ y.
We must protect our@@ sel@@ ves against fall@@ aci@@ es, such as thinking that just because a risk has not pro@@ ved dam@@ aging for decades, it no longer exist@@ s.
Yet another psych@@ ological barri@@ er is a sort of eg@@ o invol@@ vement in our own succ@@ ess.
Our tenden@@ cy to take full credit for our success@@ es disc@@ oura@@ ges us from facing up to the possibility of loss or fail@@ u@@ re, because consider@@ ing such prospec@@ ts calls into question our self-@@ sati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion.
Indeed, self-@@ es@@ te@@ em is one of the most powerful human need@@ s: a view of our own success relative to others provides us with a sense of mean@@ ing and well-@@ bein@@ g.
So accep@@ ting the essential r@@ and@@ om@@ ness of life is terri@@ bly difficul@@ t, and contra@@ dic@@ ts our deep psych@@ ological need for order and account@@ ability.
We often do not protect the things that we have - such as our opportunities to ear@@ n income and accum@@ ul@@ ate wealth - because we mistak@@ en@@ ly believe that our own natural sup@@ eri@@ ority will do that for us.
This tenden@@ cy is especially appar@@ ent when it comes to public policy.
Govern@@ ment leaders find it hard to address economic risks to the nation because it is im@@ politi@@ c to call into question the self-@@ es@@ te@@ em of their constitu@@ enc@@ y.
But no one who looks at the matter seri@@ ously can argue that the tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous inequality between the world's nations reflects fundamental differences in inher@@ ent ability or im@@ mut@@ able charac@@ ter.
The per capita GDP of India in 200@@ 0, for example, was only 7% of that of the US.
C@@ an anyone believe that this is because Americans are 1@@ 4 times sm@@ ar@@ ter or 1@@ 4 times better in charac@@ ter than Indi@@ ans@@ ?
Ob@@ vi@@ ously, these two countri@@ es@@ ' relative posi@@ tions are due to circum@@ stan@@ ces that can be chan@@ ge@@ d, or that will change in response to economic events and political decision@@ s.
But the leaders of the world's rich countries have great difficul@@ ty addres@@ sing risks to their relative success vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ v@@ is less developed countries, because national self-@@ es@@ te@@ em is too ti@@ ed up with it.
C@@ i@@ tiz@@ ens in advanced countries just can@@ 't believe - and don@@ 't want to be told - that their pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ ed status may be dis@@ si@@ p@@ ated unless pro@@ per steps are taken to ins@@ ure against the risks they fac@@ e.
For example, the world's advanced countries are scar@@ c@@ ely less dependent on oil today than they were in 197@@ 3, when the O@@ P@@ E@@ C em@@ bar@@ go sti@@ fl@@ ed their economies and sent prices so@@ ar@@ ing.
Despite occ@@ a@@ sion@@ al efforts at conserv@@ ation, rich countries always go back to "@@ business as us@@ u@@ al@@ ."
Most companies are no better at man@@ aging or even recogni@@ zing the different kin@@ ds of economic risks that their workers fac@@ e.
Many maintain insurance and pen@@ sions for their employ@@ e@@ es, but also encourage their workers to trust the company to provide for them for@@ ever@@ , and even to invest in the comp@@ any@@ 's stock@@ .
When an employ@@ e@@ e is la@@ id off in middle age, or the company goes bankrup@@ t, the sud@@ den@@ ly materi@@ alized risk may come as a shock@@ .
C@@ lear@@ ly, establish@@ ing mand@@ atory social security and health insurance program@@ s, and a social safety net for the po@@ or, has helped h@@ ed@@ ge the most fundamental risks that people fac@@ e.
The problem is the lack of any co@@ her@@ ent policy for ens@@ uring that individuals are protec@@ ted against a broader ar@@ ra@@ y of economic risks to their in@@ com@@ es, invest@@ ments, and hom@@ es.
So new risk management institutions need to be de@@ vis@@ ed.
They should use markets, rather than state guarante@@ es, and while they should not be mand@@ ator@@ y, they must be designed in acc@@ ord@@ ance with hum@@ ans@@ ' psych@@ ological limit@@ ations, so that people will use them.
We know enough about risk perc@@ ep@@ tion to recognize that helping people co@@ pe with the risks of modern life requires addres@@ sing their hear@@ ts as well as their head@@ s.
NEW YOR@@ K@@ – In their efforts to p@@ ass a bail@@ out plan for America’s financial system, Bush administration officials in@@ vo@@ ked the spec@@ ter of the Great Depression of the 193@@ 0’s.
But, for most Asi@@ ans, economic Ar@@ ma@@ ge@@ d@@ d@@ on is far more rec@@ ent.
The Asian financial crisis of a decade ago brought banks, corpor@@ ations and governments to their k@@ ne@@ es.
The b@@ on@@ fir@@ e was sp@@ ark@@ ed by the collapse of the Th@@ ai b@@ ah@@ t in the sum@@ mer of 199@@ 7.
Con@@ ta@@ gi@@ on soon spread across East Asia, with the ri@@ pp@@ le effects of seri@@ al currency de@@ valu@@ ations reach@@ ing as far as Russia and Braz@@ il.
The long-@@ running “@@ economic mi@@ ra@@ cl@@ es” of South Korea and Hong Kon@@ g en@@ ded, as did sur@@ ging growth in Indonesi@@ a and Thail@@ and.
The central lesson taken from that crisis was to maintain large foreign-@@ exchange reser@@ ves.
This became a vir@@ tual ar@@ tic@@ le of fa@@ ith among East Asian government@@ s.
B@@ ack in the 199@@ 0’s, Asi@@ a’s fa@@ st-@@ growing economies maintain@@ ed small reser@@ ves, despite boom@@ ing exports and foreign invest@@ ment.
On@@ ce the tail@@ sp@@ in began in 199@@ 7, government@@ s’ lack of reserves ham@@ per@@ ed their ability to res@@ c@@ ue failed banks, forc@@ ing them to appe@@ al to international institutions for reli@@ ef@@ .
But the International Monetary Fund@@ ’s bail@@ out came with st@@ r@@ ings att@@ ach@@ ed, including demands for more of the rapid capital market liber@@ alization that in@@ duc@@ ed the crisis in the first plac@@ e.
Indeed, what the West calls the “@@ Asian financial crisi@@ s” is known in Asia as the “@@ IMF crisi@@ s.”
The political hum@@ ili@@ ation and economic fru@@ stration of de@@ aling with IMF im@@ per@@ atives con@@ firm@@ ed the central importance of maintain@@ ing large reser@@ ves, as an issue not just of currency stabilit@@ y, but also economic sovereign@@ ty.
One Asian economy emerg@@ ed from the 199@@ 7-@@ 1998 crisis relatively un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed@@ : China.
There were many reasons for this, but for@@ emo@@ st among them was that China had already am@@ ass@@ ed more than $@@ 100 billion in reser@@ ves, and ref@@ used to re@@ value its curren@@ cy, when the crisis h@@ it.
Since then, China has aggressi@@ vely pursu@@ ed a fa@@ st-@@ growth, expor@@ t, and investment heav@@ y model of economic development.
By c@@ app@@ ing the exchange rate and produc@@ ing far more than it consum@@ es, China’s reserves gre@@ w into a Le@@ vi@@ ath@@ an, h@@ it@@ ting the $@@ 1 trillion mark in 200@@ 5.
Even after China (@@ under pressure from US Treasury offici@@ al@@ s) let the y@@ u@@ an parti@@ ally flo@@ at in 200@@ 5, the Le@@ vi@@ a@@ than kept growing by about $@@ 200 billion annu@@ ally.
O@@ ver the past year and a hal@@ f, China’s reserves sk@@ y@@ ro@@ ck@@ et@@ ed to $@@ 1.@@ 8 trilli@@ on, far and away the world’s lar@@ ges@@ t.
The Chinese state probably h@@ as@@ n’t s@@ at on so much lu@@ c@@ re since the hal@@ cy@@ on days of the Q@@ ing Emp@@ i@@ re, when ins@@ ati@@ able European demand for por@@ cel@@ ain@@ , te@@ a and sil@@ k flo@@ o@@ ded the central co@@ ff@@ ers in Beij@@ ing with sil@@ ver bul@@ li@@ on.
But the par@@ ad@@ o@@ x is that today’s reserves are not real wealth that can be p@@ ump@@ ed back into the domestic economy.

Even before Wall Street hit the sk@@ id@@ s, there was growing consensus in China that its reserves had grow@@ n far beyond what was necessary to aver@@ t another 199@@ 7-@@ style crisis.
C@@ all@@ s for a more diversi@@ fied investment strategy intensi@@ fi@@ ed.
Invest@@ ing in US Treas@@ uri@@ es, after all, was a s@@ ure los@@ s-@@ mak@@ er, given the gap between their mo@@ dest yiel@@ d and the ste@@ ad@@ y appreci@@ ation of the y@@ u@@ an.
With the creation one year ago of a $@@ 200 billion sovereign wealth fund@@ , the China Invest@@ ment Cor@@ por@@ ation, Beij@@ ing posi@@ tioned itself for more equity investment (@@ although its early invest@@ ments, in the Bl@@ ack@@ st@@ one G@@ rou@@ p and Mor@@ g@@ an St@@ an@@ le@@ y, were widely cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ z@@ ed@@ ).
Econom@@ ist An@@ dy X@@ i@@ e, form@@ er@@ ly with Mor@@ g@@ an St@@ an@@ le@@ y, proposed last we@@ ek that China trade its dollar assets for shar@@ es in US companies on a gr@@ and sc@@ al@@ e, challeng@@ ing America to over@@ come its financial x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bi@@ a in order to aver@@ t a disa@@ ster of under@@ capit@@ aliz@@ ation.
But many in China, from nation@@ alist blo@@ g@@ ger@@ s to social justice activi@@ sts, adv@@ ance a deep@@ er cri@@ ti@@ que of the Le@@ vi@@ a@@ than reser@@ ve.
Why bin@@ d up Chinese capital to finance America’s deb@@ t-@@ consumption economy, they as@@ k, when so many needs go un@@ met at hom@@ e?
China was one of the world’s most eg@@ alit@@ arian societies as late as 198@@ 5.
Today, it suff@@ ers one of the world’s biggest g@@ aps between ha@@ ves and ha@@ ve-@@ no@@ ts.
Chin@@ es@@ e-@@ style capitalism is f@@ laun@@ ting its de@@ fi@@ ance of one Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ us@@ ’ basic teach@@ ing@@ s@@ —@@ don’t wor@@ ry about pover@@ ty, he warn@@ ed, wor@@ ry about inequ@@ ality.
China’s physi@@ cal infrastructure in boom@@ ing central cities is under@@ going radical moderni@@ z@@ ation, but the social and environmental infrastructure is falling ap@@ ar@@ t, especially in the inter@@ ior and for the huge rural popul@@ ation.
For years, the central government has tal@@ ked about creating “@@ social har@@ mon@@ y@@ ”@@ —@@ with a “@@ new@@ -@@ type rural cooper@@ ative medical services system@@ ,” by increasing spending on education to 4% of GDP and elimin@@ ating school fe@@ es, and implement@@ ing “@@ sustainable develop@@ ment@@ ” model@@ s.

The challenge for China in the years to come is to di@@ v@@ est itself of American debt, and begin invest@@ ing in the heal@@ th, education and environmental well-@@ being of its own people.
Gro@@ wing the economy at an average annual rate of 10@@ %, it tur@@ ns out, may have been the easy par@@ t.
NEW YORK – Global financial markets in 2008 experienc@@ ed their worst crisis since the Great Depression of the 193@@ 0’s.
Ma@@ j@@ or financial institutions went bu@@ st@@ ; others were b@@ ought up on the che@@ ap or survi@@ ved only after major bail@@ out@@ s.
Global stock markets fell by more than 50@@ %@@ ; interest@@ -@@ rate spread@@ s sk@@ y@@ ro@@ ck@@ e@@ ted@@ ; a severe liquidity and credit c@@ run@@ ch appear@@ ed@@ ; and many emerg@@ ing-@@ market economies stag@@ ger@@ ed to the International Monetary Fund for help@@ .
So what lies ahead in 200@@ 9@@ ?
Is the worst behind us or ahead of us@@ ?
To answer these ques@@ tions, we must understand that a vi@@ ci@@ ous cir@@ cle of economic contrac@@ tion and wor@@ sen@@ ing financial conditions is under@@ way.
The United States will certainly experience its worst recession in decades, a deep and pro@@ trac@@ ted contrac@@ tion la@@ sting about 2@@ 4 months through the end of 200@@ 9.
Moreover, the entire global economy will contrac@@ t.
There will be recession in the euro z@@ one, the United King@@ dom@@ , Con@@ tin@@ ent@@ al Europe, Can@@ ad@@ a, Japan, and the other advanced economies.
There is also a risk of a hard land@@ ing for emerg@@ ing-@@ market economies, as tra@@ de, financi@@ al, and currency lin@@ ks trans@@ mit real and financial shock@@ s to them.
In the advanced economies, recession had brought back earlier in 2008 fear@@ s of 197@@ 0’@@ s-@@ style stag@@ fl@@ ation (@@ a combin@@ ation of economic stag@@ nation and inflation@@ ).
But, with ag@@ greg@@ ate demand falling below growing ag@@ greg@@ ate sup@@ pl@@ y, s@@ lack goods markets will lead to lower inflation as firm@@ s’ pric@@ ing power is res@@ tra@@ in@@ ed.
Likewise, rising unemployment will control labor costs and wage growth.
These factor@@ s, combined with sharp@@ ly falling commodi@@ ty prices, will cause inflation in advanced economies to e@@ ase toward the 1% level@@ , raising concerns about defl@@ ation, not stag@@ fl@@ ation.
Def@@ l@@ ation is dangerous as it lead@@ s to a liquidity tra@@ p@@ : nomin@@ al policy rates cannot fall below zer@@ o, so monetary policy becomes in@@ effec@@ tive.
Fall@@ ing prices mean that the real cost of capital is high and the real value of nomin@@ al deb@@ ts ris@@ e, leading to further decl@@ ines in consumption and investment – and thus set@@ ting in mo@@ tion a vi@@ ci@@ ous cir@@ cle in which in@@ comes and jobs are squ@@ ee@@ zed fur@@ ther, ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ating the fall in demand and pric@@ es.
As traditional monetary policy becomes in@@ effec@@ tive, other un@@ or@@ thodo@@ x policies will continue to be us@@ ed@@ : policies to b@@ ail out invest@@ ors, financial institutions, and bor@@ ro@@ wer@@ s; massive provi@@ sion of liquidity to banks in order to e@@ ase the credit c@@ run@@ ch@@ ; and even more radical actions to reduce long-term interest rates on government bonds and nar@@ row the spread between market rates and government bond@@ s.
Toda@@ y’s global crisis was trig@@ ger@@ ed by the collapse of the US housing bub@@ ble, but it was not caused by it.
America’s credit exc@@ esses were in res@@ idential mortg@@ ag@@ es, commercial mortg@@ ag@@ es, credit car@@ ds, au@@ to lo@@ ans, and stud@@ ent lo@@ ans.
There was also exc@@ ess in the securi@@ tiz@@ ed products that conver@@ ted these deb@@ ts into tox@@ ic financial deri@@ v@@ ativ@@ es; in borrowing by local government@@ s; in financing for lever@@ aged bu@@ you@@ ts that should never have occur@@ re@@ d@@ ; in corporate bonds that will now suff@@ er massive losses in a sur@@ ge of defaul@@ ts@@ ; in the dangerous and un@@ regul@@ ated credit default s@@ wa@@ p market.
Moreover, these pa@@ th@@ ologi@@ es were not con@@ fin@@ ed to the US.
There were housing bub@@ bl@@ es in many other countries, fuel@@ ed by excessive che@@ ap lending that did not reflect underlying risk@@ s.
There was also a commodi@@ ty bub@@ ble and a private equity and h@@ ed@@ ge funds bub@@ ble.
Indeed, we now see the de@@ mis@@ e of the sh@@ ad@@ ow banking system, the complex of non-@@ bank financial institutions that look@@ ed like banks as they borrow@@ ed short term and in li@@ qui@@ d way@@ s, lever@@ aged a lo@@ t, and invest@@ ed in longer term and illi@@ qui@@ d way@@ s.
As a result, the biggest asset and credit bub@@ ble in human history is now going bu@@ st, with overall credit losses likely to be close to a stag@@ gering $@@ 2 trilli@@ on.
Thus, unless governments rapidly rec@@ apit@@ alize financial institutions, the credit c@@ run@@ ch will become even more severe as losses moun@@ t faster than rec@@ apit@@ alization and banks are forced to contrac@@ t credit and l@@ end@@ ing.
E@@ qu@@ ity prices and other risk@@ y assets have fallen sharp@@ ly from their pe@@ ak@@ s of late 2007, but there are still significant down@@ side risk@@ s.
An emerging consensus suggests that the prices of many risk@@ y assets – including equi@@ ties – have fallen so much that we are at the bo@@ tto@@ m and a rapid recovery will occur@@ .
But the worst is still ahead of us.
In the next few month@@ s, the macroeconomic news and ear@@ n@@ ing@@ s@@ /@@ prof@@ its repor@@ ts from around the world will be much worse than expec@@ ted, put@@ ting further down@@ ward pressure on prices of risk@@ y asset@@ s, because equity analy@@ sts are still del@@ u@@ ding themselves that the economic contrac@@ tion will be mil@@ d and shor@@ t.
While the risk of a total system@@ ic financial mel@@ t@@ down has been reduced by the actions of the G-@@ 7 and other economies to back@@ stop their financial system@@ s, severe vulner@@ abilities rema@@ in.
The credit c@@ run@@ ch will get wor@@ se@@ ; del@@ ever@@ aging will continu@@ e, as h@@ ed@@ ge funds and other lever@@ aged play@@ ers are forced to sell assets into illi@@ qui@@ d and dist@@ res@@ sed markets, thus caus@@ ing more price falls and dri@@ ving more in@@ solv@@ ent financial institutions out of bus@@ ines@@ s.
A few emerg@@ ing-@@ market economies will certainly enter a ful@@ l-@@ b@@ low@@ n financial crisis.
So 2009 will be a pain@@ ful year of global recession and further financial st@@ res@@ ses, los@@ ses, and bankrup@@ t@@ cies.
Only aggressi@@ ve, coordin@@ ated, and effective policy actions by advanced and emerg@@ ing-@@ market countries can ensure that the global economy reco@@ vers in 201@@ 0, rather than ent@@ ering a more pro@@ trac@@ ted period of economic stag@@ nation@@ .
LONDON – S@@ il@@ vi@@ o Berluscon@@ i, Ital@@ y’s thre@@ e-@@ time prime minister and the country’s domin@@ ant politici@@ an for two decades, has now been con@@ vic@@ ted and sent@@ enc@@ ed to four years in pri@@ son – a sent@@ ence since reduced to one year@@ .&nbsp; But few people in Italy – or in Europe – believe that Berluscon@@ i will fa@@ de from Itali@@ an, or Europe@@ an, politics any@@ time so@@ on.
J@@ ust a few days ago, he declared his inten@@ tion to remain involved in politic@@ s, though not to run for prime minister a fo@@ ur@@ th time.
W@@ hat@@ ever role Berluscon@@ i cho@@ o@@ ses to pla@@ y, it is unlikely to be a margin@@ al one.
He may not wish to be king again, but he certainly can be a k@@ ing@@ mak@@ er, owing to his control of Medi@@ as@@ et, Ital@@ y’s largest media group@@ .
And, given his ab@@ y@@ sm@@ al popul@@ arity rat@@ ings, he may decide to play the wi@@ ld car@@ d, em@@ bra@@ ce a euro@@ -@@ skep@@ tic and anti-@@ government st@@ ance, and try to bring down Prime Minister M@@ ari@@ o Mon@@ ti@@ ’s tech@@ no@@ c@@ ratic administ@@ ra@@ tion.
Mon@@ ti@@ ’s government took over from Berluscon@@ i in November 201@@ 1, ar@@ ri@@ ving with a clear mand@@ ate, and full parliamentary suppor@@ t, to imp@@ lement the measures needed to restore market confidence and re@@ ass@@ ure Ital@@ y’s eurozone partn@@ ers and the International Monetary Fund that the country was not going down the path taken by Greec@@ e.
At the time of the G-20 summit in C@@ ann@@ es that mon@@ th, Italy – and Europe – was danger@@ ously close to collap@@ se, with Berluscon@@ i@@ ’s government deeply divi@@ ded about the fiscal measures needed to bring down the country’s deb@@ t-@@ service cost@@ s.
D@@ om@@ estic political de@@ ad@@ lock@@ , and Berluscon@@ i@@ ’s in@@ ability to eng@@ age with Germany and France resul@@ ted in sp@@ ir@@ aling re@@ financing cost@@ s, with the spread relative to German b@@ und@@ s consist@@ ently over 500 basis points between Ju@@ ly and November 201@@ 1.
The Mon@@ t@@ i government has restor@@ ed market confidence and Ital@@ y’s international credi@@ bilit@@ y.
But the overall p@@ ic@@ ture remains fragi@@ le.
The interest@@ -@@ rate spread has stabili@@ zed around a more manage@@ able 300 basis poin@@ ts, but is still higher than it was three years ago.
In addi@@ tion, Ital@@ y’s economic out@@ look remains highly uncertain@@ .
Indeed, the mo@@ dest economic recovery that should benefit many countries in 201@@ 3 seems to be el@@ u@@ ding Ital@@ y.
According to the IMF@@ , the economy will remain in recession next year, and, though the rate of contrac@@ tion will be less severe than in 2012 (@@ -@@ 0.@@ 7% in 201@@ 3, compared to -@@ 2.@@ 3% this year@@ ), the unemployment rate is expected to rise fur@@ ther, from 10@@ .@@ 6% to 1@@ 1.@@ 1@@ %.
More needs to be done in order to support economic growth in the short ter@@ m, improve the country’s fiscal position in the medi@@ um ter@@ m, and imp@@ lement the structural reforms needed to make the Itali@@ an economy more ro@@ b@@ ust and internation@@ ally competitive in the long ter@@ m.
Italy is rank@@ ed 4@@ 3@@ r@@ d in the World Economic For@@ um@@ ’s global competi@@ tiveness inde@@ x@@ , well below the main eurozone countries, owing to lack of investment – especially in human capital – and structural ri@@ gi@@ di@@ ties that have constra@@ ined growth for many years.
The answer to Ital@@ y’s economic problems is not, as Berluscon@@ i advoc@@ at@@ es, an ex@@ it from the eurozone and a return to the flexi@@ bility of its own curren@@ cy, which in the past allowed policymakers to boost competi@@ tiveness through ir@@ responsible de@@ valu@@ ations.
Italy needs to learn how to live with the euro and within the euroz@@ one, which means adop@@ ting policies that ensure that productivity growth and innov@@ ation, not currency de@@ valu@@ ation, are the main dri@@ vers of competi@@ tiven@@ ess.
A stab@@ le, comp@@ et@@ ent, and responsible government with a com@@ for@@ table parliamentary majority is essential to continue what Mon@@ ti@@ ’s government has initi@@ ated.
While the od@@ ds still favor a relatively smo@@ o@@ th transi@@ tion, many uncertain@@ ties could der@@ ail the reform process.
In particul@@ ar, whether Italy will be able to move beyond tech@@ no@@ c@@ ratic politics to a “@@ normal@@ ” government remains the out@@ standing question both at home and for the other eurozone member states.
From this per@@ spec@@ tive, what Berluscon@@ i advoc@@ ates for Ital@@ y, and the consequences of his agenda for the euroz@@ one, is not good new@@ s.
An@@ y hin@@ t that the country may be lock@@ ed again in parliamentary in@@ er@@ ti@@ a, as in the final months of Berluscon@@ i@@ ’s last government, would push the markets to question the credi@@ bility of Ital@@ y’s fis@@ c@@ al-@@ consolid@@ ation pl@@ an, je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zing the country’s ability to re@@ finance its debt.
That debt is the largest in the eurozone – at roughly €@@ 2 trillion (@@ $@@ 2.@@ 6 trilli@@ on@@ ), or 1@@ 20% of the country’s GDP – which means that Italy can be help@@ ed, but not res@@ cu@@ ed.
With potential inst@@ ability lo@@ om@@ ing, Mon@@ t@@ i should ensure that Italy is not def@@ en@@ sel@@ ess in the ev@@ ent of another round of market inst@@ ability.
Un@@ like some months ago, now the European Central Bank can interven@@ e and buy troub@@ led countries’ debt.
But this mechan@@ ism can be activ@@ ated only by form@@ al re@@ ques@@ t.
Italy should follow this rou@@ te without del@@ a@@ y.
It is better to have a powerful weap@@ on that may ga@@ ther d@@ ust than to be un@@ armed in a time of ne@@ ed.
From September 10@@ -@@ 1@@ 4, trade ministers from around the world will meet for the next stage of what is supposed to be the Development Ro@@ und of trade tal@@ k@@ s.
At their last meeting in D@@ oh@@ a in November 2001, ministers recognized the ine@@ qui@@ ties of the previous round of trade negoti@@ ations, the U@@ ru@@ gu@@ ay round@@ .
This round was supposed to re@@ d@@ ress those im@@ balanc@@ es.
One would have thought that the developing countries would look forward to the meeting as a chance to achieve a fair@@ er global trading system.
Instead, many fear that what has happened in the past will happen again@@ : secre@@ t negoti@@ ations, ar@@ m t@@ wi@@ st@@ ing, and the disp@@ la@@ y of bru@@ te economic power by the US and Europe@@ --@@ and by special interests in the advanced countri@@ es@@ --@@ aimed at ens@@ uring that the interests of the rich are protec@@ ted.
While some progress has been made in making the negotiations more open and transpar@@ ent, efforts to go further have met with resist@@ ance, and for good reason@@ : un@@ bal@@ anced proc@@ esses help ensure un@@ bal@@ anced out@@ com@@ es.
Iron@@ ically, the World Trade Organ@@ iz@@ ation, where each country has one vo@@ te, might seem far more ``@@ democrati@@ c@@ '' th@@ an, say, the IMF@@ , where a single country, the US, has a v@@ et@@ o.
Yet the re@@ al@@ politik of economic power has ensu@@ red that the interests of the developed countries pre@@ domin@@ ate.
H@@ ere is a short ch@@ eck@@ list against which to ass@@ ess whether the out@@ comes of C@@ anc@@ u@@ n repres@@ ent a move towards a true development round .
· A@@ gri@@ cultu@@ re. Most people in the developing world live in the rural sector@@ , which is why free and fair trade in agri@@ culture mat@@ ters.
It@@ 's not just a question of providing acc@@ ess, but of elimin@@ ating the subsi@@ dies that encourage production in rich countries and har@@ m farm@@ ers in poor countries.
The numbers are truly al@@ arm@@ ing@@ : subsi@@ dies in advanced countries exc@@ e@@ ed the total income of sub@@ -S@@ ahar@@ an Afric@@ a@@ ; the average European sub@@ sid@@ y per co@@ w mat@@ ches the $@@ 2 per day poverty level on which billi@@ ons of people bar@@ ely subsi@@ st@@ ; America's $@@ 4 billion co@@ tt@@ on subsi@@ dies to 25@@ ,000 well-@@ off farm@@ ers bring mis@@ er@@ y to 10 million African farm@@ ers and more than off@@ set America's mis@@ er@@ ly foreign aid to some of the affec@@ ted countries.
Although both Europe and America acc@@ use each other of un@@ fair agricultural policies, neither side seems willing to make major conc@@ ession@@ s.
· Dru@@ gs and intellectual proper@@ ty. T@@ R@@ I@@ P@@ S@@ , the intellectual property regime adopted in the last round of trade negoti@@ ations, de@@ priv@@ ed millions in the developing world of access to life@@ -@@ saving dru@@ g@@ s.
As a ch@@ or@@ us of resear@@ ch@@ ers has poin@@ ted out, the provi@@ sions, push@@ ed by the p@@ har@@ mac@@ eu@@ tical compani@@ es, were so un@@ bal@@ anced that they were bad for scientific progres@@ s.
Her@@ e, there has been some progres@@ s@@ --@@ but not enough@@ .
Pro@@ vi@@ sions de@@ man@@ ded by the US would have made it difficult for small countries, like Bo@@ ts@@ wan@@ a, to gain aff@@ ord@@ able acc@@ ess.
Develop@@ ing countries also continue to wor@@ ry about bi@@ o-@@ pi@@ rac@@ y-@@ -@@ the pat@@ enting by Western firms of traditional fo@@ ods and dru@@ g@@ s.
· T@@ ex@@ ti@@ l@@ es. The U@@ ru@@ gu@@ ay round promised the elimin@@ ation of quo@@ t@@ as in 200@@ 4, enab@@ ling many developing countries to explo@@ it another area of compar@@ ative advan@@ ta@@ ge.
But many developing countries wor@@ ry that trade restric@@ tions will rema@@ in, whether through ``@@ saf@@ eg@@ u@@ ard@@ s@@ '' to protect jobs or through high t@@ ari@@ ff@@ s.
Many also fear that the West will find some way to wi@@ gg@@ le out of its commit@@ ments.
· A more bal@@ anced liber@@ alization agenda@@ . With services com@@ pri@@ sing an increasing share of production in developed countries, attention has shif@@ ted to liber@@ alization of trade in servic@@ es.
A more bal@@ anced agenda would balance attemp@@ ts to e@@ ase capital flows with efforts to facilit@@ ate the f@@ low of lab@@ or, including un@@ skill@@ ed lab@@ or.
· Com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion. E@@ ver@@ y@@ one advoc@@ ates ``@@ fair competi@@ tion@@ .@@ ''
But discus@@ sions about competition and fair trade again demon@@ st@@ rate the intellectual poverty and inequ@@ ity of trade negoti@@ ations.
Anti@@ -@@ d@@ ump@@ ing laws are inten@@ ded to ensure fair trade by prev@@ enting the s@@ ale of goods below co@@ st.
Wi@@ thin the developed countries, there has long been concern about such behavi@@ or@@ --@@ so-called ``@@ pre@@ d@@ ation@@ '@@ '@@ --@@ and well-@@ defin@@ ed standards have been develop@@ ed.
With globaliz@@ ation, it would be natural to ex@@ tend such principles to the international ar@@ en@@ a, making it ir@@ relevant whether a produc@@ er is domestic or foreign when jud@@ ging whether he is eng@@ aged in an un@@ fair trade practic@@ e.
But it does make a difference whether a good is produced at home or ab@@ road@@ .
Foreign produc@@ ers are acc@@ used of ``@@ un@@ fair@@ '' competition far more easily than domestic produc@@ ers.
Indeed, if the standards of domestic trade laws were app@@ lied internation@@ ally, perhaps a majority of firms within the US would be gu@@ il@@ ty of d@@ ump@@ ing.
Yet America's Su@@ pre@@ me Court has set standards so high for American firms to be found gu@@ il@@ ty of pre@@ d@@ ation that few cases are success@@ fully pro@@ sec@@ uted dom@@ es@@ tic@@ ally.
The trade negoti@@ ators are not even disc@@ uss@@ ing elimin@@ ating this dou@@ ble stand@@ ar@@ d.
So developing countries wor@@ ry that efforts to intro@@ duce ``@@ competi@@ tion@@ '' within trade negotiations will only make life even more difficul@@ t.
They wor@@ ry that efforts to promote domestic industri@@ es or provide prefer@@ ential treatment to dis@@ adv@@ ant@@ aged groups (the kind of aff@@ ir@@ m@@ ative action programs that have been so import@@ ant, both in developed and less developed countri@@ es@@ ) will be lab@@ el@@ ed ``@@ un@@ fair@@ '' to foreign firm@@ s, and thus be pro@@ hi@@ bit@@ ed.
There is a real danger that what was inten@@ ded to re@@ m@@ ed@@ y the im@@ balances of previous trade round@@ s will not only fail to do so, but may intro@@ duce new im@@ balanc@@ es.
P@@ ush@@ ing countries to liber@@ alize their capital markets and open them up to specul@@ ative capital flows is one examp@@ le.
At the very moment when the IMF has finally recognized that such liber@@ alization may produce inst@@ ability but not growth, the WT@@ O is now pursu@@ ing it.
F@@ ail@@ ure at C@@ anc@@ u@@ n would con@@ fir@@ m the fear@@ s of those who resist@@ ed a new round of trade negoti@@ ations.
Ne@@ ed@@ less to say, it would also provide support for the anti-@@ globalization pro@@ test@@ ors every@@ wher@@ e.
CAMBRIDGE ­@@ – There is a serious danger that the international adop@@ tion of cap@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ trade legisl@@ ation to limit car@@ b@@ on-@@ di@@ ox@@ ide emissions will trig@@ ger a new round of protection@@ ist meas@@ ur@@ es.
While aimed at reducing long-term environmental dam@@ age, cap@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ trade policies could produce significant har@@ m@@ ful economic effects in the near term that would continue into the future.
S@@ ci@@ enti@@ fic evidence appears to indic@@ ate that the accum@@ ulation of CO2 in the at@@ mosph@@ ere from the bur@@ ning of fossi@@ l fu@@ els (@@ pri@@ mar@@ ily co@@ al, o@@ il, and natural gas@@ ) – mainly in electric@@ ity produc@@ tion, tran@@ spor@@ t@@ ation, and various industrial proc@@ esses – contribut@@ es to gradu@@ al global warm@@ ing, with long-term ad@@ verse effects on living conditions around the world.
It is with this in min@@ d that represent@@ atives of more than 1@@ 50 countries are sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed to meet in Copen@@ hagen in Dec@@ ember to disc@@ uss ways to reduce CO2 emis@@ sions.
A common sug@@ ges@@ tion is to impose a tax on all CO2 emis@@ sions, which would be le@@ vi@@ ed on companies that em@@ it CO2 in produc@@ tion, or that sell products like gas@@ ol@@ ine that cause CO2 emissions when us@@ ed.
Such a tax would cause electric@@ ity companies and industrial firms to adop@@ t techni@@ qu@@ es that reduce their CO2 emis@@ sions, as long as the cost of doing so is less than the tax that they would other@@ wise have to pa@@ y.
The higher cost of production in@@ cur@@ red to reduce emissions – and of any emissions tax still due – w@@ oul@@ d, of course, be inclu@@ ded in the price charg@@ ed to consu@@ mer@@ s.
Con@@ sum@@ ers would respond to the tax@@ -@@ in@@ duc@@ ed increase in the cost of the emis@@ sion@@ s-@@ inten@@ sive products by reducing their consumption of those goods and services in favor of goods and services that create smaller amoun@@ ts of CO2 emis@@ sions.
A carbon tax causes each fir@@ m and household to respond to the same cost of ad@@ ding CO2 to the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ her@@ e.
That uni@@ form individual cost incen@@ tive allow@@ s total CO2 to be reduced at a lower total cost than would be achieved by a vari@@ ety of administ@@ rative require@@ ments, such as autom@@ ob@@ ile mi@@ lea@@ ge standard@@ s, production technology standards (@@ e@@ .@@ g@@ ., minim@@ um renew@@ able fuel in@@ put@@ s in electric@@ ity gener@@ ation@@ ), et@@ c.
Yet we do not see carbon taxes being adop@@ ted.
Although governments lev@@ y taxes on gas@@ ol@@ ine, they are rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ant to impose a general carbon tax because of public opposition to any form of tax@@ ation.
Govern@@ ments have therefore focused on a cap@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ trade system as a way of increasing the cost of CO2-@@ inten@@ sive products without exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly im@@ posing a tax@@ .
In a cap@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ trade system, the government s@@ ets total allow@@ able national emissions of CO2 per year and requires any fir@@ m that causes CO2 emissions to have a per@@ mit per ton of CO2 em@@ it@@ ted.
If the government s@@ ells these per@@ m@@ its in an au@@ c@@ tion, the price of the per@@ mit would be a cost to the fir@@ m in the same way as a carbon tax – and with the same resulting increases in consumer pric@@ es.
The cap@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ trade system thus im@@ poses a carbon tax without having to ad@@ mit that it is really a tax@@ .
A cap@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ trade system can cause serious risks to international tra@@ de.
Even if every country has a cap@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ trade system and all a@@ im at the same relative reduction in national CO2 emis@@ sions, the resulting per@@ mit prices will diff@@ er because of national differences in ini@@ tial CO2 levels and in domestic production character@@ istic@@ s.
Because the price of the CO2 per@@ m@@ its in a country is reflec@@ ted in the prices of its produc@@ ts, the cap@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ trade system affec@@ ts its international competi@@ tiven@@ ess.
When the per@@ mit prices become large enough to have a significant effect on CO2 emis@@ sions, there will be political pressure to intro@@ duce t@@ ari@@ ff@@ s on impor@@ ts that off@@ set the advantage of countries with low per@@ mit pric@@ es.
Such off@@ set@@ ting t@@ ari@@ ff@@ s would have to diff@@ er among products (@@ being higher on more CO2-@@ inten@@ sive produc@@ ts@@ ) and among countries (@@ being higher for countries with low per@@ mit pric@@ es@@ ).
Such a system of complex differ@@ ential t@@ ari@@ ff@@ s is just the kind of protection@@ ism that governments have been working to elimin@@ ate since the start of the G@@ A@@ T@@ T process more than 50 years ago.
Wor@@ se still@@ , cap@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ trade systems in practi@@ ce do not rely sol@@ ely on au@@ c@@ tions to distribu@@ te the emissions per@@ mit@@ s.
The plan working its way through the United States Congress (the W@@ a@@ x@@ man@@ -@@ Mark@@ ey b@@ ill@@ ) would initi@@ ally give away 8@@ 5% of the per@@ mit@@ s, impose a complex set of regulatory policies, and allow companies to buy CO2 off@@ s@@ ets (@@ e@@ .@@ g@@ ., by pa@@ ying for the plan@@ ting of tre@@ es@@ ) instead of reducing their emissions or bu@@ ying per@@ mit@@ s.
Such comp@@ lexi@@ ties make it impossible to comp@@ are the impact of CO2 policies among countries, which in turn would inv@@ ite those who want to protect domestic jobs to argue for higher t@@ ari@@ ff level@@ s.
There is no easy answer to this problem.
But before rus@@ h@@ ing to impose t@@ ari@@ ff@@ s, it is important to re@@ member that cap@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ trade policies would not be the only government source of differences in competi@@ tiven@@ ess.
Bet@@ ter road@@ s, port@@ s, and even school@@ s all contribute to a country’s competi@@ tiven@@ ess.
No one attemp@@ ts to use t@@ ari@@ ff@@ s to balance those government@@ -@@ created differences in competi@@ tiven@@ ess, and there should be no such attemp@@ ts if a cap@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ trade system is introduc@@ ed.
If an international agreement to impose a cap@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ trade schem@@ e is adopted in Copen@@ ha@@ gen, the countries there should agree as well that there will be no attempt to intro@@ duce off@@ set@@ ting t@@ ari@@ ff@@ s that would ultimately thre@@ aten our global system of free tra@@ de.
When the International Olymp@@ ic Commit@@ tee a@@ war@@ ded Beij@@ ing the 2008 Sum@@ mer G@@ am@@ es in Ju@@ ly 2001, the announc@@ ement ig@@ n@@ ited wi@@ ld cel@@ eb@@ ra@@ tions across the country.
The Chinese Communist Party hop@@ ed to use the G@@ am@@ es to show@@ case the country’s emer@@ gence as a dynam@@ ic@@ , modern nation@@ .
But as China’s leaders begin final prepar@@ ations for the G@@ am@@ es next Au@@ gu@@ st, they may be won@@ der@@ ing if ho@@ sting the ev@@ ent was such a good idea after all.
They have significant reasons for dou@@ bt.
China’s senior leaders always clo@@ sely monit@@ or sp@@ on@@ tane@@ ous public ex@@ pres@@ sions of nation@@ alist fer@@ vor, fear@@ ful that shif@@ ting win@@ ds might b@@ low an un@@ wel@@ come stor@@ m in their direc@@ tion.
Of course what they hope is that the G@@ am@@ es will chan@@ ne@@ l these energi@@ es toward national solidar@@ ity, which will allow the leadership to deli@@ ver its people a moment of achiev@@ ement and pat@@ rio@@ tic gl@@ or@@ y.
But the Olymp@@ ics will also bring inten@@ se international sc@@ ru@@ tin@@ y of China’s weak@@ n@@ esses at a de@@ lic@@ ate moment in the country’s development.
The world already knows of China’s success and its attrac@@ tiveness as a dest@@ in@@ ation for foreign invest@@ ment, but few out@@ si@@ ders have seen fir@@ sth@@ and the ste@@ ep price the country is pa@@ ying for its new prosper@@ ity.
The most obvious sig@@ ns of that cost f@@ low through the country’s w@@ ater@@ ways and con@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ ate its air@@ .
R@@ un@@ away growth and development have left about 7@@ 0% of China’s l@@ ak@@ es and ri@@ vers sever@@ ely poll@@ u@@ ted, many un@@ f@@ it for human use of any kin@@ d.
Indeed, nearly a hal@@ f-@@ billion Chinese lack access to cle@@ an drin@@ king wat@@ er, and the number of ter@@ min@@ ally poll@@ uted ri@@ vers and l@@ ak@@ es grow@@ s da@@ il@@ y.
But air quality will prove the more em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ sing problem next Au@@ gu@@ st.
T@@ el@@ evi@@ sion cover@@ age of ath@@ le@@ tes gas@@ p@@ ing for bre@@ ath will hardly provide Beij@@ ing with the sig@@ nature Olymp@@ ic ima@@ ge it had in min@@ d, and growing international an@@ xi@@ ety over climate change and other environmental ha@@ z@@ ards will ensure that such issues receive consider@@ able media cover@@ age.
There is also the risk that the G@@ am@@ es will become a political cir@@ c@@ us, as the international spo@@ t@@ light gener@@ ates ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble opportunities for public protes@@ t.
The Chinese leadership has demonstrat@@ ed many times that it can qu@@ ell domestic dis@@ s@@ ent, but the uni@@ que scale of the Olymp@@ ics will require round@@ -@@ th@@ e-@@ clo@@ ck vi@@ gil@@ ance.
Ac@@ tivi@@ sts with gri@@ ev@@ ances over Tibe@@ t, Taiw@@ an, Bur@@ ma, Dar@@ fur@@ , and do@@ z@@ ens of other politic@@ al, environ@@ ment@@ al, and human@@ -@@ rights issues are already making plan@@ s.
Is China ready for Green@@ peac@@ e, Hum@@ an R@@ igh@@ ts in China, Am@@ n@@ est@@ y Internation@@ al, and F@@ al@@ u@@ n G@@ ong suppor@@ ters to take to the stre@@ et@@ s, with thousands of foreign journ@@ alists hung@@ ry for st@@ ories and as@@ king questions that the authorities are un@@ acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to answer@@ ing@@ ?
Even if police are able to maintain order in Beij@@ ing, can they ex@@ tend that control across the countr@@ y?
C@@ an they manage the f@@ low of information and ideas through the blo@@ go@@ sph@@ ere as on@@ line activi@@ sts open yet another fron@@ t in their batt@@ le for free inform@@ ation@@ ?
What we do know that Chinese officials have never faced a challenge of this scale with such a potential to both win and lose fac@@ e.
The G@@ am@@ es will generate significant foreign-@@ policy risks as well.
In Taiw@@ an, out@@ going President Ch@@ en S@@ hu@@ i-@@ bi@@ an is sti@@ r@@ ring the independence po@@ t, know@@ ing that the Olymp@@ ic spo@@ t@@ light will limit Beij@@ ing@@ ’s ability to respond forc@@ eful@@ ly.
He has already proposed a popular refer@@ endum on Tai@@ wan@@ ese membership in the United Nation@@ s.
China’s influence within the UN would prevent such a move even if Taiwan voted y@@ es, but an international confron@@ tation is the last thing China wants co@@ inci@@ ding with the Olymp@@ ic@@ s.
Th@@ en there is the matter of how the G@@ am@@ es will be received in the Wes@@ t.
Since 2001, China has increasingly become the fo@@ cal point of much an@@ xi@@ ety in the developed world.
Hu@@ ge bilateral trade defic@@ its, acc@@ us@@ ations that China ke@@ ep@@ s its currency under@@ valu@@ ed, and a ra@@ sh of def@@ ec@@ tive and dangerous Chin@@ es@@ e-@@ made exports have fuel@@ ed a protection@@ ist b@@ ac@@ kl@@ ash in the United States and Europe.
Am@@ id bit@@ ter elec@@ tion@@ -@@ year deb@@ ates over Iraq and Iran, and a sour@@ ing economic out@@ look@@ , Americans may be in no mo@@ od for the tri@@ ump@@ ha@@ list pa@@ ge@@ an@@ try of a new rising power on disp@@ la@@ y in Beij@@ ing.
Will China’s un@@ easy Asian neighbor@@ s be any more rec@@ ep@@ tiv@@ e?
International critic@@ ism is s@@ ure to follow if som@@ eth@@ ing, any@@ th@@ ing, goes wrong during the G@@ am@@ es, especially if it invol@@ ves the sup@@ pression of dis@@ sent and is v@@ ec@@ tor@@ ed around the world via 2@@ 4@@ -@@ h@@ our c@@ able tel@@ evi@@ sion and the Intern@@ et.
China has changed since it “@@ won@@ ” the 2008 gam@@ es se@@ ven years ago.
The Party leadership has grow@@ n more self-@@ assu@@ red in its growing international ro@@ le, but its ability to manage the p@@ ace of change at home has become more uncertain@@ .
In 2001, then President Ji@@ ang Z@@ em@@ in hop@@ ed the G@@ am@@ es would her@@ ald China’s ar@@ ri@@ val as an industri@@ alized power.
But his success@@ or, Hu J@@ in@@ ta@@ o, has focused on the damage that has come from un@@ res@@ tra@@ ined growth.
He and Pre@@ mi@@ er W@@ en Ji@@ ab@@ a@@ o have also ch@@ amp@@ i@@ oned a more “@@ har@@ mon@@ i@@ ous@@ ” societ@@ y, because they understand that the growing wealth g@@ ap@@ , social ten@@ sions, environmental and public health problem@@ s, and the Par@@ t@@ y’s ten@@ u@@ ous relationship with China’s less adv@@ ant@@ aged people can no longer be neg@@ lec@@ ted.
As China’s leaders sc@@ ra@@ m@@ ble to address these challen@@ ges, will they still reli@@ sh the idea of providing an international au@@ di@@ ence with fron@@ t-@@ row se@@ ats@@ ?
How they look back on the G@@ am@@ es once the conf@@ ett@@ i is s@@ we@@ p@@ t from the stre@@ ets is far from certain@@ .
NEW YORK – China’s willingness to join negotiations on potential sanctions against Iran and to sen@@ d President Hu J@@ in@@ ta@@ o to a nuclear security summit in Washington this month are important pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary steps towards taking more responsibility in man@@ aging international affair@@ s.
But merely jo@@ ining con@@ vers@@ ations or show@@ ing up for me@@ et@@ ings is not enough@@ .
Given its growing profi@@ le, China must do far more to demon@@ st@@ rate its b@@ on@@ a fi@@ des as a responsible global leader or risk undermin@@ ing the system that has enab@@ led its own mi@@ rac@@ ul@@ ous ri@@ se.
China has emerg@@ ed as a world power far more quickly than most obser@@ vers – and China’s own leaders – might have predic@@ ted as little as a decade ago.
China’s rapid economic growth, ju@@ x@@ ta@@ posed against America’s problems in Iraq and Afghanistan, mon@@ um@@ ent@@ al debt, and role in sp@@ ark@@ ing the global financial crisis, have changed global power re@@ ali@@ ties – and global perc@@ ep@@ tions of those re@@ ali@@ ties even more.
China’s current international influence likely out@@ stri@@ ps its desire or capac@@ ity.
This put@@ s China in a difficult position in rel@@ ation to the so-called international system – the structu@@ res and rules created by the United States and others after the Sec@@ ond World War to ch@@ ec@@ k national sovereign@@ ty through a system of over@@ l@@ app@@ ing ju@@ ris@@ dic@@ tions, trans@@ national oblig@@ ations, and fundamental righ@@ ts.
China has been an enormous ben@@ e@@ fici@@ ary of this system, and its rise would have been un@@ think@@ able without the US-@@ led fre@@ e-@@ trade system and globalization proc@@ ess, access to US markets, and global shi@@ pp@@ ing lan@@ es secu@@ red by the US N@@ av@@ y.
But China’s history of hum@@ ili@@ ation at the hands of European col@@ oni@@ al powers has made its leaders ard@@ ent suppor@@ ters of in@@ viol@@ able national rights and susp@@ ici@@ ous of any sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce of sovereign@@ ty.
Because China’s leaders are not popul@@ arly elec@@ ted, their legitimacy st@@ em@@ s largely from two sources – their connec@@ tion to the Chinese revolution and their ability to deli@@ ver national security and economic growth.
Although Ma@@ o Z@@ ed@@ ong is widely implic@@ ated in the un@@ necessary death of millions and is offici@@ ally desig@@ n@@ ated by the current regime as having been 3@@ 0% wron@@ g, his p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ p@@ h still ad@@ or@@ ns Ti@@ an@@ an@@ men S@@ quar@@ e, because the regi@@ me@@ ’s legitimacy depends in part on its connec@@ tion to the restor@@ ation of national sovereign@@ ty that Ma@@ o represent@@ s.
The economic found@@ ation of the Chinese government’s legitimacy also places an enormous burden on China’s leaders to make decisions that fo@@ ster domestic economic growth at the exp@@ ense of virtually everything el@@ se – inclu@@ d@@ ing, some say, the vi@@ ability of the international currency regi@@ me, nuclear non-@@ prolifer@@ ation, and basic rights in resourc@@ e-@@ rich countries.
This di@@ cho@@ tom@@ y cre@@ ates a difficult situation as China emerg@@ es as the world’s second largest economy.
If China, in the name of national sovereign@@ ty, does not buy into the international system, it becomes hard to argue that this system exist@@ s.
China’s un@@ willing@@ n@@ ess, for example, to join other members of the international community in pres@@ sur@@ ing Iran and North Korea to aband@@ on nuclear weapons programs for@@ es@@ ha@@ dow@@ s the potential collapse of the nuclear non-@@ prolifer@@ ation regi@@ me.
China’s active cour@@ t@@ ship of countries that viol@@ ate human rights on a massive sc@@ al@@ e, such as Sud@@ an, North Korea, and Bur@@ ma, simil@@ arly repres@@ ents a pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary de@@ capit@@ ation of the international human rights regi@@ me.
Given its size and import@@ ance, and reg@@ ardless of its inten@@ tions, China will, perhaps in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ently, destro@@ y the international system if it does not either ac@@ tively end@@ or@@ se and work to maintain it, or re@@ fra@@ me it for the greater common go@@ od.
If it does nei@@ ther, the world is in troub@@ le.
If China se@@ es itself as the h@@ eir and ben@@ e@@ fici@@ ary of the US-@@ led post-@@ war international system, it must do much more to prevent and ro@@ ll back nuclear prolifer@@ ation in Iran and North Korea, pay a much greater percentage of costs for the United Nation@@ s, and cur@@ ta@@ il its mer@@ can@@ ti@@ list policies.
It must also end its al@@ leg@@ ed corrup@@ t practi@@ ces in resourc@@ e-@@ rich parts of the developing world, ali@@ g@@ n its currency policy with global norm@@ s, lead efforts to cur@@ b green@@ hous@@ e-@@ gas emis@@ sions, and, more gener@@ ally, take into more account the f@@ ate of people outside of China in its decision@@ -@@ mak@@ ing.
I@@ f, on the other hand, as is its righ@@ t, Chinese leaders have an alternative vision of what an improved international system might look lik@@ e, the on@@ us is on them to ar@@ ticul@@ ate that vision and out@@ line what they are willing to do to re@@ alize it.
There may be a better international model than the current one, but it will not emer@@ ge by defaul@@ t.
As US Pres@@ id@@ ents Frank@@ lin Ro@@ ose@@ vel@@ t and Har@@ ry Tru@@ man demonstrat@@ ed in the 194@@ 0’s, such a system must be ar@@ ticul@@ ated and then for@@ ged through deci@@ sive action and global leader@@ ship.
If China se@@ es in@@ viol@@ able state sovereign@@ ty as the found@@ ation of twent@@ y-@@ first century international affair@@ s, as now appears to be the case, then it must explain why this principle will not lead to the same disa@@ stro@@ us consequences as it did in the n@@ ine@@ te@@ enth and early twenti@@ eth cent@@ uri@@ es.
The US and the international community must acknow@@ ledge that today’s fa@@ st-@@ rising China has ear@@ ned the right to play an important role in shap@@ ing how the twent@@ y-@@ first century un@@ fol@@ ds.
But if China’s leaders will neither do more to support the current international system, nor ar@@ ticul@@ ate an altern@@ ative, and instead continue to har@@ k back to n@@ ine@@ te@@ enth@@ -@@ century model@@ s of in@@ viol@@ able sovereign@@ ty, they will destro@@ y a global order that, war@@ ts and all, has ser@@ ved the world exc@@ e@@ ed@@ ingly well.
Those countries that value the current system will increasingly feel the ur@@ ge to close ran@@ ks to def@@ end it.
CAMBRIDGE – Thir@@ ty years ago, China had a tin@@ y fo@@ ot@@ prin@@ t on the global economy and little influence outside its bor@@ ders, save for a few countries with which it had close political and military relation@@ ship@@ s.
Today, the country is a remark@@ able economic power@@ : the world’s manufacturing work@@ sh@@ op@@ , its for@@ emo@@ st financi@@ er, a leading invest@@ or across the g@@ lo@@ be from Africa to Latin America, and, increas@@ ing@@ ly, a major source of research and development.
The Chinese government si@@ ts at@@ op an ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing level of foreign reserves – greater than $@@ 2 trilli@@ on.
There is not a single business any@@ where in the world that has not fel@@ t China’s imp@@ ac@@ t, either as a low-@@ cost supp@@ li@@ er, or more threat@@ en@@ ing@@ ly, as a form@@ id@@ able competi@@ tor@@ .
China is still a poor country.
Although average in@@ comes have ri@@ sen very rapidly in recent decades, they still stand at between one-@@ se@@ v@@ enth and one-@@ ei@@ gh@@ th the levels in the United States – lower than in Turkey or Col@@ ombi@@ a and not much higher than in E@@ l Sal@@ v@@ ad@@ or or Egyp@@ t.
While co@@ ast@@ al China and its major met@@ ro@@ poli@@ ses ev@@ in@@ ce tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous weal@@ th, large s@@ wa@@ th@@ s of Western China remain mi@@ red in pover@@ ty.
Nevertheless, China’s economy is projec@@ ted to sur@@ p@@ ass that of the US in size some@@ time in the next two decades.
Meanwhile, the US, the world’s sol@@ e economic hy@@ per@@ -@@ power until rec@@ ently, remains a dimin@@ ished gi@@ ant. It stands hum@@ b@@ led by its foreign-@@ policy bl@@ under@@ s and a massive financial crisis.
Its credi@@ bility after the disa@@ stro@@ us inv@@ asion of Iraq is at an all-@@ time low@@ , not@@ with@@ standing the global symp@@ ath@@ y for President Barack Obam@@ a, and its economic model is in t@@ at@@ ters.
The on@@ c@@ e-@@ al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty dollar tot@@ ters at the mer@@ cy of China and the o@@ il@@ -@@ rich states.
All of which rais@@ es the question of whether China will eventually re@@ place the US as the world’s he@@ gemon@@ , the global econom@@ y’s rule set@@ ter and en@@ forc@@ er.
In a fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating new book@@ , reve@@ al@@ ingly ti@@ t@@ led When China R@@ ul@@ es the World , the British sch@@ ol@@ ar and journ@@ alist Mar@@ ti@@ n J@@ acqu@@ es is un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cal@@ : if you think China will be integ@@ rated smo@@ o@@ th@@ ly into a liber@@ al, capit@@ ali@@ st, and democratic world system, J@@ acqu@@ es argu@@ es, you are in for a big surpri@@ se.
Not only is China the next economic super@@ power, but the world order that it will construc@@ t will look very different from what we have had under American leader@@ ship.
Americans and Europeans bli@@ th@@ ely assu@@ me that China will become more like them as its economy develop@@ s and its population ge@@ ts rich@@ er.
This is a mi@@ ra@@ ge, J@@ acqu@@ es sa@@ y@@ s.
The Chinese and their government are w@@ ed@@ ded to a different conc@@ ep@@ tion of society and poli@@ ty@@ : commun@@ it@@ y-@@ based rather than individu@@ ali@@ st, state-@@ cent@@ ri@@ c rather than liber@@ al, authoritarian rather than democrati@@ c.
China has 2@@ ,000 years of history as a distinc@@ t civili@@ zation from which to draw streng@@ th.
It will not simply fol@@ d under Western values and institutions.
A world order cent@@ ered on China will reflect Chinese values rather than Western on@@ es, J@@ acqu@@ es argu@@ es.
Beij@@ ing will over@@ sh@@ ad@@ ow New Yor@@ k, the ren@@ minbi will re@@ place the doll@@ ar, M@@ and@@ ar@@ in will take over from Engli@@ sh@@ , and school@@ children around the world will learn about Z@@ h@@ en@@ g H@@ e’s vo@@ y@@ ages of dis@@ co@@ very along the Eastern co@@ ast of Africa rather than about V@@ as@@ c@@ o de G@@ am@@ a or Chri@@ st@@ op@@ her Col@@ um@@ bus@@ .
G@@ one will be the ev@@ ange@@ li@@ sm of markets and democracy.
China is much less likely to inter@@ f@@ ere in the internal affair@@ s of sovereign states.
But, in retur@@ n, it will demand that sm@@ all@@ er, less powerful states exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly recognize China’s prim@@ acy (@@ just as in the tri@@ but@@ ary systems of old@@ ).
Be@@ fore any of this comes to pas@@ s, however, China will have to continue its rapid economic growth and maintain its social co@@ h@@ esi@@ on and political un@@ ity. N@@ one of this is guarante@@ ed.
B@@ ene@@ ath China’s powerful economic dynam@@ o li@@ e deep ten@@ sions, inequ@@ ali@@ ties, and c@@ lea@@ v@@ ages that could well der@@ ail a smo@@ o@@ th progres@@ sion to global he@@ gemon@@ y.
Th@@ rough@@ out its long history, cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ g@@ al forces have often push@@ ed the country into dis@@ ar@@ ra@@ y and di@@ sin@@ tegra@@ tion.
China’s stability h@@ ing@@ es critic@@ ally on its government’s ability to deli@@ ver ste@@ ad@@ y economic gains to the vast majority of the popul@@ ation.
China is the only country in the world where anything less than 8% growth year after year is believed to be dangerous because it would un@@ leas@@ h social un@@ res@@ t.
Most of the rest of the world only dre@@ ams about growth at that rat@@ e, which spe@@ ak@@ s volum@@ es about the underlying fragi@@ lity of the Chinese system.
The authoritarian nature of the political regime is at the core of this fragi@@ li@@ ty.
It allow@@ s only repres@@ sion when the government faces protests and opposition outside the established chan@@ n@@ el@@ s.
The troub@@ le is that it will become increasingly difficult for China to maintain the kind of growth that it has experienc@@ ed in recent years. China’s growth currently reli@@ es on an under@@ valu@@ ed currency and a huge trade surpl@@ us.
This is un@@ sustain@@ able, and so@@ on@@ er or later it will pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ate a major confron@@ tation with the US (and Europe@@ ).
There are no easy ways out of this di@@ le@@ m@@ ma@@ .
China will likely have to sett@@ le for lower growth.
If China sur@@ moun@@ ts these hur@@ d@@ les and does eventually become the world’s pre@@ domin@@ ant economic power, globalization will, indeed, take on Chinese character@@ istic@@ s.
Democ@@ ra@@ cy and human rights will then likely lose their lu@@ ster as global norm@@ s.
That is the bad new@@ s.
The good news is that a Chinese global order will disp@@ la@@ y greater respect for national sovereign@@ ty and more toler@@ ance for national diversi@@ ty.
There will be greater ro@@ om for experi@@ ment@@ ation with different economic model@@ s.
Communist China has experienc@@ ed a mon@@ um@@ ent@@ al capit@@ alist revolution in the last two decades, with an economy that is now six times big@@ ger than it was 20 years ago.
A min@@ or play@@ er in the global economy in the 198@@ 0’s, China today is the world’s third largest trading power.
But if these st@@ un@@ ning economic statisti@@ cs make you think that so much capit@@ alist development must also have brought more democracy to China, think again@@ .
Most Wes@@ tern@@ ers believe in a theory of liberal ev@@ olu@@ tion, according to which sustained economic growth, by increasing wealth and the size of the middle cl@@ as@@ s, gradu@@ ally makes a country more democrati@@ c.
While the long-@@ run record of this theory is ir@@ re@@ fut@@ able, China’s authoritarian ruling eli@@ te is not only determined to hold on to power, but it also has been sm@@ art enough to take adap@@ tive measures aimed at counter@@ ing the liber@@ aliz@@ ing effects of economic development.
Thus, for all its a@@ we@@ -@@ in@@ sp@@ iring economic achiev@@ em@@ ent, China has made remark@@ ably little progress in political liber@@ aliz@@ ation.
Indeed, jud@@ ging by several key indic@@ ator@@ s, progress toward democracy in China has st@@ alle@@ d, despite unpreced@@ ented economic prosperity and personal freedom@@ .
For inst@@ ance, in the mid-@@ 198@@ 0’s, Chinese leaders seri@@ ously discus@@ sed and later dre@@ w up a blu@@ ep@@ rin@@ t for mo@@ dest democratic reform@@ s.
Today, the top@@ ic of political reform is t@@ abo@@ o.
N@@ early all the major institutional reform@@ s, such as strength@@ ening the legis@@ lat@@ u@@ re, holding vil@@ lage elec@@ tions, and building a modern legal system, were laun@@ ched in the 198@@ 0’s.
Since the Ti@@ an@@ an@@ men S@@ qu@@ are mass@@ ac@@ re of Jun@@ e 198@@ 9, however, not a single major democratic reform initi@@ ative has been implement@@ ed.
Inste@@ ad of democratic transi@@ tion, China has witn@@ essed a consolid@@ ation of authoritarian rule – the strength@@ ening of a one-@@ party regime through organiz@@ ational lear@@ ning and adap@@ t@@ ation.
Since 198@@ 9, the Chinese Communist Party (@@ C@@ C@@ P@@ ) has been pursu@@ ing a two-@@ p@@ ron@@ ged strateg@@ y: sel@@ ec@@ tive repres@@ sion that targe@@ ts organiz@@ ed political opposition and co-@@ op@@ tation of new social eli@@ tes (the intel@@ lig@@ ent@@ si@@ a, profession@@ als, and private entrep@@ rene@@ ur@@ s@@ ).
This strategy empha@@ si@@ zes the main@@ ten@@ ance of an exten@@ sive law en@@ forc@@ ement appar@@ at@@ us designed to elimin@@ ate any inci@@ pi@@ ent organiz@@ ed opposi@@ tion.
Hu@@ ge investments have strength@@ ened the Peop@@ le’s Arm@@ ed Poli@@ ce (@@ P@@ A@@ P@@ ), a large anti-@@ ri@@ ot par@@ am@@ ilit@@ ary force whose speci@@ al@@ ty is the qu@@ ick sup@@ pression of anti-@@ government protests by dis@@ gr@@ un@@ t@@ led industrial work@@ ers, pe@@ as@@ ant@@ s, and urban res@@ id@@ ents.
Fre@@ qu@@ ent dep@@ loy@@ ment of the P@@ A@@ P is a major reason why the tens of thousands of collective protests that occ@@ ur each year (@@ 7@@ 4@@ ,000 in 2004 and 8@@ 6@@ ,000 in 200@@ 5@@ ) have had a neg@@ ligi@@ ble impact on China’s overall stabilit@@ y.
To deal with new emerging political threat@@ s, such as the information revolu@@ tion, the Chinese government has spent m@@ igh@@ ti@@ ly on man@@ power and technolog@@ y.
A special 3@@ 0,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ strong police un@@ it monit@@ ors and s@@ cre@@ ens Internet tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ , advanced technology is dep@@ loy@@ ed to blo@@ ck access to over@@ se@@ as W@@ eb si@@ tes considered “@@ hosti@@ le or har@@ m@@ ful@@ ,” and Internet service and con@@ tent provi@@ ders, both domestic and Wes@@ tern, must comp@@ ly with on@@ er@@ ous restric@@ tions designed to sup@@ press political dis@@ sent and tra@@ ck down offen@@ der@@ s.
The regime has even conduc@@ ted multi@@ -@@ agen@@ cy exerc@@ is@@ es to test whether different government bo@@ dies could cooper@@ ate clo@@ sely to keep “@@ har@@ m@@ ful inform@@ ation@@ ” off the N@@ et during an emer@@ gen@@ cy.
Ha@@ ving learned from the collapse of the Soviet Union that a bureauc@@ ratic ruling party must co-@@ op@@ t new social eli@@ tes to de@@ pri@@ ve potential opposition groups of leader@@ s, the Communist Party has conduc@@ ted an effective campaign of exp@@ anding its social bas@@ e.
The urban intel@@ lig@@ ent@@ si@@ a and profession@@ als have been p@@ am@@ per@@ ed with materi@@ al per@@ ks and political recogni@@ tion, while new private entrep@@ rene@@ urs have been allowed to join the Par@@ ty.
This strategy of pre-@@ emp@@ tive political de@@ capit@@ ation has produced enormous divi@@ den@@ ds for the Par@@ ty.
In the 198@@ 0’s, its princip@@ al ad@@ vers@@ aries were the urban intel@@ lig@@ ent@@ si@@ a, who con@@ stit@@ uted the back@@ b@@ one of the pro-@@ democracy movement that cul@@ min@@ ated in Ti@@ an@@ an@@ men S@@ quar@@ e.
Today, the main@@ stre@@ am of the Chinese intel@@ lig@@ ent@@ si@@ a is an integra@@ l part of the ruling eli@@ te.
Many have jo@@ ined the Party and become government offici@@ als, and a large percentage enjo@@ y various profession@@ al and financial pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ges.
Pre@@ dict@@ ab@@ ly, the intel@@ lig@@ ent@@ si@@ a, usually the most liberal social group@@ , is no longer a le@@ th@@ al threat to party ru@@ le.
Wor@@ se, without support from this strategic group@@ , other social group@@ s, such as workers and pe@@ as@@ ant@@ s, have become politically margin@@ alized and ru@@ d@@ der@@ l@@ ess.
Although the Par@@ t@@ y’s car@@ ro@@ t-@@ and@@ -@@ sti@@ ck approach has worked since 198@@ 9, it is doub@@ t@@ ful that it will re@@ tain its eff@@ ic@@ acy for another 1@@ 7 years.
To the extent that China’s authoritarian regime is by nature exclu@@ sion@@ ary (@@ it can only in@@ corporate a limited number of eli@@ tes@@ ), the co-@@ op@@ tation strategy will soon run up against its limit@@ s, and the Party will no longer have the resources to buy off the intel@@ lig@@ ent@@ si@@ a or keep private entrep@@ rene@@ urs happ@@ y.
At the same time, sel@@ ec@@ tive repres@@ sion can con@@ tain social fru@@ stra@@ tions and dis@@ con@@ tent only tempor@@ ar@@ il@@ y.
As long as much of Chinese society views the current political system as un@@ ju@@ st, un@@ responsi@@ ve, and corrup@@ t, there will always be a large reser@@ vo@@ ir of ill will toward the ruling eli@@ t@@ es.
When things go wrong – as is lik@@ el@@ y, given moun@@ ting social stra@@ ins caused by rising inequ@@ ality, environmental de@@ gra@@ d@@ ation, and deter@@ i@@ or@@ ating public services – China’s alien@@ ated mass@@ es could become politically radic@@ aliz@@ ed.
And, un@@ like past pro@@ test@@ s, which have usually been alli@@ ed with students or members of the intel@@ lig@@ ent@@ si@@ a, popular disa@@ ff@@ ec@@ tion might not have the vir@@ tu@@ e of rational leaders with whom the government could talk and negoti@@ ate.
So it may be pre@@ mat@@ ure for the Party to cel@@ eb@@ rate the success of its adap@@ tive strateg@@ y.
China’s rul@@ ers may have st@@ all@@ ed democratic tren@@ ds for now, but the current strategy h@@ as, perh@@ ap@@ s, merely del@@ a@@ yed the inevit@@ able.
On Oc@@ tober 1, 194@@ 9, as Chi@@ ang K@@ ai@@ -@@ ch@@ ek@@ 's defe@@ ated Ku@@ omin@@ t@@ ang (@@ K@@ M@@ T@@ ) troops fl@@ ed for Taiw@@ an, Ma@@ o Z@@ ed@@ ong declared that "@@ China has stood up@@ ."
China h@@ as, indeed, stood up@@ , and continues to rise as one of the world's largest economies.
Last year, China alone accoun@@ ted for roughly 60@@ % of global export growth.
But in a crisis, China's diplomatic influence usually res@@ em@@ bl@@ es that of some peripher@@ al back@@ wat@@ er.
No@@ where does this seem tru@@ er than in China's own back@@ y@@ ar@@ d.
Beij@@ ing@@ 's seem@@ ing sil@@ ence over the nuclear ambi@@ tions of North Korea has left US, Japan@@ es@@ e, and South Korean officials ali@@ ke won@@ der@@ ing when it will "@@ stand up@@ " to asser@@ t its influence over its neigh@@ b@@ or and er@@ st@@ while ally.
One reason China seems par@@ aly@@ zed in the current crisis is that, among the world's major power@@ s, it is almost alone in having a genu@@ ine "@@ two Kore@@ as@@ " policy.
Since China established diplomatic relations with South Korea in the early l@@ 9@@ 9@@ 0@@ '@@ s, economic ties have grow@@ n dramati@@ call@@ y, and cultural relations have expan@@ ded at a compar@@ able p@@ ac@@ e.
China also re@@ ci@@ proc@@ ated out@@ going President Kim Da@@ e-@@ j@@ ung@@ 's over@@ tures in the politic@@ al-@@ security re@@ al@@ m, despite South Kore@@ a's strategic ties with the US.
But in recogni@@ zing South Korea, China took greater care th@@ an, say, Russia, in seeking to am@@ eli@@ or@@ ate North Kore@@ a's an@@ x@@ ie@@ ties.
China is North Kore@@ a's most important trading partn@@ er, with tur@@ no@@ ver exc@@ e@@ ed@@ ing $@@ 7@@ 00 million in 200@@ 2, up 3@@ 0% from 200@@ 1.
Indeed, China is believed to supply about 7@@ 0% of the Nor@@ th@@ 's o@@ il, and has doub@@ led its s@@ ales of gra@@ in and ve@@ get@@ ab@@ l@@ es.
While China no longer promises the North military support (@@ exc@@ ept in the ev@@ ent of external attack@@ ), "@@ con@@ sul@@ t@@ ations@@ " are p@@ led@@ ge@@ d.
Priv@@ ately, China's leaders are du@@ bi@@ ous (@@ at best@@ ) about North Kore@@ a.
They think that economic reform is long over@@ du@@ e, and, like other@@ s, consider Kim J@@ on@@ g-@@ il@@ 's political system bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re.
For their par@@ t, North Kore@@ a's eli@@ te under@@ stands that they have no true allies at pres@@ ent, not even in Beij@@ ing.
Yet Kim J@@ on@@ g-@@ il@@ 's two tri@@ ps to China illu@@ st@@ rate his interest in China's reforms and his desire to cul@@ tiv@@ ate China's suppor@@ t.
How much the Chinese know about the inn@@ er work@@ ings of North Kore@@ a's polic@@ y-@@ making and power structu@@ re, and how much influence they can ha@@ ve, are uncertain@@ .
China claims that its power over P@@ y@@ ong@@ y@@ ang is limit@@ ed.
What China wants above all is to prevent North Korea from collap@@ s@@ ing, whatever the cau@@ se.
Con@@ f@@ lic@@ t on the Korean pen@@ ins@@ ul@@ a, n@@ ou@@ ri@@ shed by the vit@@ ri@@ oli@@ c langu@@ age often employ@@ ed by Kim J@@ on@@ g-@@ il@@ 's regi@@ me, is China's ni@@ gh@@ t@@ mar@@ e.
War between the Kore@@ as would confron@@ t Beij@@ ing with a flo@@ od of hundreds of thousands of refu@@ ge@@ es.
E@@ qu@@ ally import@@ ant, China is war@@ y of the prospect of Korea being uni@@ fied under South Korean rule and backed up by continued strategic support from the US.
For@@ tun@@ ately, North Kore@@ a's leaders pre@@ fer survi@@ val to su@@ ici@@ de.
They know that despite the exten@@ sive damage that they could inf@@ lic@@ t on the Sou@@ th, in the end, they would be destro@@ yed by American and South Korean power if comb@@ at ever star@@ ts.
H@@ ence, war initi@@ ated by the Nor@@ th, while not un@@ think@@ able, seems un@@ lik@@ el@@ y.
A third possibility is an in@@ defin@@ ite continu@@ ation of the status quo@@ .
Th@@ is, too, seems doub@@ t@@ ful@@ .
North Korea is a fail@@ ing state economic@@ ally, a fact that Kim J@@ on@@ g-@@ il and his c@@ ron@@ ies appear to recogni@@ z@@ e.
Since the mid-@@ l@@ 9@@ 9@@ 0@@ '@@ s, they have been ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ing@@ --@@ al@@ beit cau@@ ti@@ ously and uncertain@@ l@@ y-@@ -@@ a@@ ven@@ u@@ es of change, including f@@ law@@ ed price liber@@ alization many prices in mid-@@ 200@@ 2.
W@@ hat@@ ever the event@@ ual out@@ come, the status qu@@ o is un@@ ten@@ able.
A fo@@ ur@@ th altern@@ ative, favor@@ ed by China and other key play@@ ers, is an ev@@ olu@@ tionary process that combin@@ es economic reform with increased inter@@ action with the external world, foc@@ using initi@@ ally on South Kore@@ a.
China will move car@@ eful@@ ly but firm@@ ly in promoting this pa@@ th.
It is an@@ xi@@ ous to see a US-@@ North Korea dialo@@ gue beg@@ in, one capable of alle@@ vi@@ ating the Nor@@ th@@ 's an@@ x@@ ie@@ ties about an American attack and America's concerns about a renew@@ ed nuclear program@@ .
Indeed, the main factor fuel@@ ing the current crisis and complic@@ ating its res@@ olution is that the North has only one bar@@ gain@@ ing chi@@ p@@ : threat@@ s.
Asi@@ de from a p@@ ledge of non-@@ aggres@@ sion, its central interest is in ob@@ tain@@ ing economic assi@@ st@@ ance.
Yet the US and others are war@@ y of being lab@@ el@@ ed appe@@ as@@ ers.
Wel@@ l aw@@ are of the comp@@ lexi@@ ties and ha@@ z@@ ard@@ s@@ --@@ and seeking to avoid alien@@ ating any of the parti@@ es@@ --@@ China is willing to play the role of conven@@ er, but not adju@@ dic@@ ator@@ , of an Americ@@ an-@@ North Korean dialo@@ gu@@ e.
Thus, its proc@@ la@@ im@@ ed "@@ dis@@ agreem@@ ent@@ " with North Kore@@ a's withdraw@@ al from the N@@ on-@@ Pro@@ lifer@@ ation Treaty was relatively mil@@ d.
N@@ on@@ eth@@ eless, China's st@@ ake in the outcome of the current crisis is big enough to make it a party to a wide range of exchan@@ ges, form@@ al and inform@@ al, bilateral and multilater@@ al-@@ -@@ all with the objec@@ tive of promoting change without up@@ heav@@ al on the Korean pen@@ ins@@ ul@@ a.
In this respec@@ t, the US and China have common interest@@ s, as do Japan, Russia, and South Kore@@ a.
China, too, believ@@ es that if advoc@@ ates of "@@ regime chan@@ ge@@ " do not push North Korea too har@@ d, a strategy can be pursu@@ ed that is based on slow ev@@ olution rather than a pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ous break@@ --@@ and a possible violent break@@ dow@@ n.
NE@@ W@@ P@@ OR@@ T B@@ E@@ A@@ C@@ H – When it comes to descri@@ bing Europe’s ever@@ -@@ wor@@ sen@@ ing crisis, met@@ ap@@ h@@ ors abo@@ und@@ .
For som@@ e, it is five min@@ utes to mid@@ ni@@ gh@@ t; for other@@ s, Europe is a c@@ ar acceler@@ ating towards the ed@@ ge of a cli@@ ff@@ .
For all, a per@@ il@@ ous exist@@ ential moment is increasingly close at hand@@ .
Op@@ tim@@ ists – fortunately, there remain a fe@@ w@@ , especially in Europe itself – believe that when the situation becomes really critic@@ al, political leaders will turn things around and put Europe back on the path of economic growth, job cre@@ ation, and financial stabilit@@ y.
But p@@ essi@@ m@@ ists have been growing in number and influ@@ ence.
They see political dy@@ sf@@ unc@@ tion ad@@ ding to financial tur@@ mo@@ il, thereby amp@@ lif@@ ying the euroz@@ one’s ini@@ tial desig@@ n f@@ law@@ s.
Of course, who is ultimately pro@@ ven correc@@ t is a func@@ tion of eurozone government@@ s’ willingness to make the difficult decisions that are require@@ d, and in a coordin@@ ated and tim@@ ely fas@@ hi@@ on.
But that is not the only determin@@ ant@@ : governments must also be able to turn things around once the willingness to do so materi@@ aliz@@ es.
And her@@ e, the end@@ less del@@ a@@ ys are making the challenges more da@@ un@@ ting and the outcome more uncertain@@ .
Ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ ed obser@@ vers remin@@ d us that cri@@ ses, rather than vi@@ sion, have ten@@ ded to drive progress at critical st@@ ages of Europe’s histor@@ ic integration – a multi@@ -@@ decade j@@ our@@ ney driven by the desire to ensure long-term peace and prosperity in what pre@@ viously had been one of the world’s most violent regions and the si@@ te of app@@ all@@ ing human suff@@ er@@ ing.
After all, the European Union (@@ including the euroz@@ one’s 1@@ 7 member@@ s) remains a collective of nation@@ -@@ states with no@@ table diver@@ gen@@ ces in economic@@ , financi@@ al, and social condi@@ tions.
C@@ ul@@ tural differences persi@@ st.
Politi@@ cal cy@@ cl@@ es are far from syn@@ chron@@ iz@@ ed.
And too many regional governance mechan@@ ism@@ s, with the important excep@@ tion of the European Central Bank, lack sufficient influ@@ ence, credi@@ bilit@@ y, and, there@@ for@@ e, effec@@ tiven@@ ess.
L@@ ef@@ t to its own de@@ vic@@ es, such a group@@ ing is vulnerable to rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ent bi@@ ck@@ er@@ ing, dis@@ rup@@ tive post@@ ur@@ ing, and dis@@ agreement over vi@@ sions of the future.
As a result, progress towards mean@@ ing@@ ful economic and political integration can be pain@@ fully slow during the good tim@@ es.
But all of this can change rapidly when a crisis lo@@ om@@ s, especially if it threat@@ ens the integri@@ ty of the European projec@@ t.
That is where the eurozone is today.
A debt crisis that er@@ up@@ ted in Greec@@ e, the euroz@@ one’s ou@@ ter peripher@@ y, has mig@@ rated with a ven@@ ge@@ ance towards the cor@@ e, so much so that the survi@@ val of the eurozone itself is at stak@@ e.
The more the policy response has lag@@ ge@@ d, the broader the set of questions about Europe’s future has be@@ come.
M@@ ain@@ tain@@ ing a 17@@ -@@ member monetary union is no longer a gi@@ v@@ en.
T@@ al@@ k of countries ex@@ it@@ ing, star@@ ting with Greece (the “@@ Gre@@ x@@ it@@ ”@@ ), is now ra@@ mp@@ ant.
And only har@@ d-@@ core ide@@ alists dis@@ mis@@ s al@@ together the moun@@ ting risk of the euroz@@ one’s total di@@ sin@@ tegra@@ tion.
N@@ on@@ eth@@ eless, many ve@@ ter@@ ans of the European integration project see a sil@@ ver lin@@ ing in the dar@@ k cl@@ ou@@ ds mass@@ ing over their cre@@ ation.
For them, only a crisis can stop politicians from just k@@ i@@ ck@@ ing various c@@ ans far@@ ther down the road and, inste@@ ad, cat@@ aly@@ ze the policy initi@@ atives – greater fis@@ c@@ al, bank@@ ing, and political union – that, together with monetary uni@@ on, would ensure that the eurozone res@@ ts on a stable and sustainable fo@@ ur@@ -@@ leg@@ ged plat@@ form@@ .
But this view is not without its own risk@@ s.
It assum@@ es that, when push comes to sho@@ ve, political leaders will inde@@ ed do what is necessary – the willingness ques@@ tion.
It also pres@@ um@@ es that they will have the capacity to do so – the ability ques@@ tion.
And, over time, uncertain@@ ty concern@@ ing the lat@@ ter question has ri@@ sen to an un@@ com@@ for@@ table level@@ .
Toda@@ y’s eurozone is bes@@ et by an unpreced@@ ented degree of rejec@@ tion – on economic@@ , financi@@ al, politic@@ al, and social ground@@ s –@@ &nbsp;@@ by citizens in a growing number of countries.
The longer this persi@@ sts, the har@@ der it will be for politicians to maintain control of their countries’ dest@@ ini@@ es and that of Europe’s collective enterpri@@ se.
Privat@@ e-@@ sector ac@@ tivity is slow@@ ing, and it is ne@@ aring a stand@@ still in the euroz@@ one’s most vulnerable economy (@@ Greec@@ e@@ ), where a bank run is in full s@@ w@@ ing.
El@@ se@@ wher@@ e, too, deposi@@ tors are beginning to trans@@ fer their savings to the stron@@ gest economy (@@ German@@ y@@ ) and to safe ha@@ v@@ ens beyond (@@ S@@ wi@@ tz@@ er@@ land and the United Stat@@ es@@ ).
We@@ ak@@ er companies are sh@@ ed@@ ding lab@@ or, while stronger firms are del@@ a@@ ying investments in pl@@ ant and equi@@ p@@ ment.
And global investors continue to ex@@ it the eurozone in dro@@ ves, shif@@ ting countries’ li@@ abilities to taxpay@@ ers and the EC@@ B@@ ’s balance she@@ et.
No won@@ der that social un@@ rest is evi@@ dent in a growing number of countries.
No won@@ der that f@@ rin@@ ge political movem@@ ents are gain@@ ing trac@@ tion throughout the euroz@@ one.
And no won@@ der that voters in almost two-@@ thir@@ ds of eurozone countries have turned out the inc@@ um@@ b@@ ents in their most recent elec@@ tions.
All of this ser@@ ves to undermin@@ e the effec@@ tiveness of government policies – by reducing their credi@@ bilit@@ y, clo@@ g@@ ging their chan@@ n@@ els of trans@@ mission to the economy, and making it difficult to off@@ set the withdraw@@ al of priv@@ ate-@@ sector capital and spend@@ ing.
As a result, the market@@ -@@ based economic and financial systems that prev@@ ail in Europe, and that, not so long ago, were a source of significant streng@@ th, are los@@ ing their vi@@ bran@@ cy.
I@@ , too, am f@@ ond of met@@ ap@@ hor@@ s.
During a tri@@ p to the contin@@ ent last week@@ , I hear@@ d one that cap@@ tures very well the key dynam@@ ic in Europe today.
The euroz@@ one’s leaders are on a ra@@ ft head@@ ing towards a life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening w@@ ater@@ fall@@ .
The longer they wa@@ it, the more the ra@@ ft gains spe@@ ed.
So the outcome no longer depends only on their willingness to cooper@@ ate in order to n@@ avi@@ g@@ ate the ra@@ ft to saf@@ et@@ y.
It also h@@ ing@@ es on their ability to do so in the mid@@ st of natural forces that are increasingly difficult to control and over@@ come.
The message is cle@@ ar.
The current crisis might inde@@ ed eventually break eurozone leader@@ s’ inher@@ ent resist@@ ance to com@@ promis@@ e, coll@@ abor@@ ation, and common ac@@ tion.
But the longer they bi@@ ck@@ er and di@@ ther, the greater the risk that what they gain in willingness will be lost to in@@ capac@@ ity.
President George W. Bush will soon tra@@ v@@ el to Europe, and President J@@ acqu@@ es Chi@@ ra@@ c will visit Washingt@@ on.
EU “@@ Foreign Minister@@ ” J@@ a@@ vier Sol@@ an@@ a has already been ther@@ e, and re@@ turned bul@@ li@@ sh on future transatlan@@ tic cooper@@ ation.
At@@ mosph@@ eri@@ call@@ y, at lea@@ st, relations ha@@ ve, indeed, improved since the US presidential elec@@ tion, and both sides have ex@@ pressed good will@@ .
Yet there is little ground for genu@@ ine optim@@ ism.
Bush’s declared inten@@ tion to “@@ better explain the reasons for his decision@@ s” to America’s Al@@ lies simply will not do@@ .
Europeans don’t want explan@@ ations@@ ; they want to be con@@ sul@@ ted – to have in@@ put into American decision@@ -@@ making and see their concerns reflec@@ ted in US foreign policy.
N@@ one of this is likely to happ@@ en.
On the contrary, the US is continuing to th@@ war@@ t European efforts gradu@@ ally to establish a ru@@ le-@@ based international order@@ .
There are no sig@@ ns that the Bush administration is rel@@ enting on, for example, the UN@@ , the Kyoto Proto@@ col@@ , the International Cri@@ min@@ al Cour@@ t, the ban on land min@@ es, or the Anti@@ -@@ B@@ alli@@ stic Mis@@ si@@ le Treat@@ y.
In Iraq, Europeans fully share the American objec@@ tives of preser@@ ving the country’s unity and achiev@@ ing at least some mo@@ dic@@ um of democracy.
At the same time, they believe that it is up to the US to re@@ move the cha@@ os it cre@@ ated, so they are rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ant to contribute to the task in a sub@@ stan@@ tive way.
European attitu@@ des may seem short@@ si@@ gh@@ ted to Americ@@ ans, but it would need a lot of c@@ a@@ j@@ ol@@ ing to change them.
There is general agreement on the aim@@ s to be achieved in the Israeli@@ -@@ Palestinian conflic@@ t: the end of violence and a peaceful solution based on the conc@@ ept of two sovereign states.
However, Europeans consider the opinion recently ex@@ pressed by Bush – that Palestinian democracy and not Israeli occup@@ ation of the West Bank is at the core of the problem – to be ill conc@@ ei@@ v@@ ed.
The same is true with respect to the Pres@@ id@@ ent@@ ’s asser@@ tion that Israel’s permanent presence in Palestinian terri@@ tor@@ ies and the non-@@ return of Palestinian refu@@ ge@@ es to their hom@@ es in Israel must be accepted as re@@ ali@@ ties on the ground@@ .
It may well be that such pain@@ ful de@@ vi@@ ations from agreed principles will be reflec@@ ted in an event@@ ual comprehensive sett@@ le@@ ment, but pre@@ jud@@ ging these issues before the beginning of negotiations den@@ ies the Palestinians some of their most important bar@@ gain@@ ing chi@@ p@@ s.
On the question of Iran’s nuclear weapons cap@@ abilit@@ y, Americans and Europeans also fundament@@ ally agre@@ e: it should be prev@@ ent@@ ed.
While the US tries to achieve this through hard power, regime change, sanc@@ tions, and threats of pre-@@ emp@@ tive military interven@@ tion, Europe uses soft power, diplom@@ ac@@ y, inclu@@ sion, and partner@@ ship.
Unfortunately, this “@@ good co@@ p@@ , bad co@@ p@@ ” g@@ ame do@@ es@@ n’t work in international politics.
European efforts to in@@ duce T@@ eh@@ er@@ an to ren@@ oun@@ ce its nuclear desig@@ ns by addres@@ sing Iran’s legitimate security concerns and off@@ ering important opportunities for economic and social bet@@ ter@@ ment cannot be successful without active US suppor@@ t.
In other words, Europe’s car@@ ro@@ ts are not enough@@ ; a successful outcome requires American car@@ ro@@ ts, to@@ o.
By standing asi@@ de and dis@@ coun@@ ting the European approach from the out@@ se@@ t, America is merely helping to bring about a self-@@ ful@@ fill@@ ing pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y.
It would be more productive for the US to join in, at the same time agre@@ eing with Europeans on measures to be taken should their combined efforts fail@@ .
R@@ el@@ ations with China have improved over the years on both sides of the Atlan@@ tic@@ .
China has become Europe’s biggest trading partn@@ er, and its huge reserves of US dollars has made it America’s most important credi@@ tor@@ .
Despite this ros@@ y p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re, China could be the cause of a major transatlan@@ tic row if Europeans make good on their inten@@ tion to li@@ ft the arms export em@@ bar@@ go in place since the Ti@@ an@@ an@@ men S@@ qu@@ are mass@@ ac@@ re of 198@@ 9.
The Bush administration is fi@@ erc@@ ely op@@ posed to lif@@ ting the em@@ bar@@ go@@ , poin@@ ting out that in the ev@@ ent of a military cl@@ ash over Taiw@@ an, US troops would face weapons provided to China by America’s own alli@@ es.
In fact, European ass@@ ur@@ ances that arms s@@ ales to China could be controlled and threats to an ally avo@@ ided do appear un@@ convinc@@ ing.
On the other hand, economic inter@@ depen@@ dence between Taiwan and main@@ land China has grow@@ n to such an extent that an armed conflict is increasingly un@@ lik@@ el@@ y.
Of course, this would change were Taiwan to push for indepen@@ den@@ ce, but it would hardly do so without a no@@ d from Washingt@@ on.
In shor@@ t, on many of the most important current international issu@@ es, Americans and Europeans share the same objec@@ tives and basic go@@ als.
Wh@@ ere they often diver@@ ge is in the means to achieve them.
Politi@@ cal wis@@ dom would demand that the two sides po@@ ol their consider@@ able resources and mar@@ ch together wh@@ en@@ ever possible.
Th@@ is, however, requires a change of attitu@@ des both in America and in Europe.
Bush must be willing to accept Europeans as genu@@ ine partn@@ ers and stop tre@@ ating them like rec@@ al@@ c@@ it@@ rant v@@ ass@@ als.
European leaders must over@@ come any lat@@ ent Anti@@ -@@ Americ@@ an@@ ism and be prepared to make the kind of contribu@@ tions to common en@@ de@@ a@@ vor@@ s that would enti@@ t@@ le them to equal partner@@ ship with the US.
ST@@ O@@ C@@ K@@ H@@ O@@ L@@ M – What will Europe’s growth tra@@ jec@@ tory look like after the financial crisi@@ s?
For some Europe@@ ans, still ner@@ v@@ ous that their economies and banking systems might collap@@ se, this is a little like as@@ king a pas@@ sen@@ ger on the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic what they plan to do when they ar@@ ri@@ ve in New Yor@@ k.
But it is a crucial question to as@@ k, especially when Europe has been facing so much outside pressure from the lik@@ es of the United States and the International Monetary Fund to focus on short-term Keyn@@ esi@@ an stimulus policies.
Tru@@ e, things are pre@@ t@@ ty u@@ gly right now.
Europe’s income is projec@@ ted to fall a stag@@ gering 4% this year.
Un@@ employment will soon be in dou@@ ble dig@@ its throughout most of the Con@@ tin@@ ent, with Sp@@ an@@ ish and Lat@@ vi@@ an unemployment on tra@@ ck to exc@@ e@@ ed 20@@ %.
Europe’s banking system remains si@@ ck@@ ly, even though many national governments have gone to great l@@ eng@@ th@@ s to hi@@ de their bank@@ s’ wo@@ es.
Yet, u@@ gly or not, the down@@ turn will eventually end.
Y@@ es, there is still a real risk of h@@ it@@ ting an ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g, beginning perhaps with a default in the Bal@@ tic@@ s, with pan@@ ic first spread@@ ing to Au@@ stri@@ a and some Nor@@ di@@ c countries.
But, for now, a complete mel@@ t@@ down seems distinc@@ tly less likely than gradu@@ al stabili@@ zation followed by a te@@ p@@ id recover@@ y, with so@@ aring debt levels and ling@@ ering high unemploy@@ ment.
It is not a pre@@ t@@ ty p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re.
Some com@@ ment@@ ators have sav@@ aged Europe’s policymakers for not or@@ ch@@ est@@ rating as aggressive a fiscal and monetary policy as their US counter@@ parts ha@@ ve.
Why el@@ se is Europe suff@@ ering a deep@@ er recession than America, they comp@@ la@@ in, when everyone agre@@ es that the US was the ep@@ ic@@ enter of the global financial mel@@ t@@ down@@ ?@@  
But these critic@@ s seem to pres@@ um@@ e that Europe will come out of the crisis in far worse shap@@ e than the US, and it is too early to make that jud@@ g@@ ment.
An ep@@ ic@@ , financi@@ al-@@ crisi@@ s-@@ driven recession@@ , such as the one we are still experienc@@ ing, is not a one-@@ year ev@@ ent.
So policy@@ mak@@ er@@ s’ respon@@ ses cannot be ev@@ al@@ u@@ ated by short-term meas@@ ures, ei@@ ther.
It is just as important to ask what happ@@ ens over the next five years as over the next six month@@ s, and the j@@ ury is still very much out on th@@ at.
America’s hy@@ per@@ -@@ aggressive fiscal response means a faster rise in government debt, while its hy@@ per@@ -@@ expan@@ sive monetary policy means that an ex@@ it strategy to mo@@ p up all the exc@@ ess liquidity will be difficult to execu@@ te.
Govern@@ ment spending in the US has ri@@ sen in short order from 18@@ % to 2@@ 8% of in@@ come, while the US Federal Reserve has effectively tri@@ pl@@ ed its balance she@@ et.
Europe’s more tem@@ per@@ ed approach@@ , while ma@@ gni@@ fying short-term risk@@ s, could pay off in the long run@@ , especially if global interest rates ris@@ e, making it far more pain@@ ful to carry over@@ si@@ zed debt lo@@ ad@@ s.
The real question is not whether Europe is using suffici@@ ently aggressive Keyn@@ esi@@ an stimul@@ us, but whether Europe will res@@ um@@ e its economic reform efforts as the crisis ab@@ at@@ es.
If Europe continues to make its labor markets more flexi@@ ble, its financial market regulation more genu@@ in@@ ely pan@@ -@@ Europe@@ an, and remains open to tra@@ de, tren@@ d growth can p@@ ick up again in the w@@ ake of the crisis.
If European countries look in@@ war@@ d, however, with Germany push@@ ing its consum@@ ers to buy German car@@ s, the French government forc@@ ing c@@ ar companies to keep un@@ productive factor@@ ies op@@ en, et@@ c@@ ., one can expect a decade of stag@@ nation@@ .
Ad@@ mit@@ ted@@ ly, the past year has not been a pro@@ u@@ d one for policy reform in Europe.
Rec@@ es@@ sions have never pro@@ ven an easy time for European leaders to push forward with reform@@ s.
M@@ at@@ ters were not helped when the C@@ ze@@ ch government lost a confidence vote mid@@ way through its si@@ x@@ -@@ month presiden@@ cy of the European Union, leaving a lam@@ e duc@@ k European Commission@@ .
The sh@@ ad@@ ow of for@@ th@@ coming elections in Germany, together with concern over whether I@@ ris@@ h voters will rati@@ fy the Lis@@ bon treaty (@@ giving Europe a b@@ adly needed new constitu@@ tion@@ ), has con@@ spi@@ red to im@@ pe@@ de reform moment@@ um.
Yet Europe’s many strength@@ s, including strong democratic governments and sound legal institutions, are often under@@ -@@ rated as long-term competitive strength@@ s in today’s glob@@ alized economy.
The recent recession has pres@@ ented challen@@ ges, but European leaders were right to avoid becoming in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ated with short-term Keyn@@ esi@@ an policies, especially where these are in@@ im@@ ical to addres@@ sing Europe’s long-term challen@@ ges.
If reform res@@ um@@ es, there is no reason why Europe should not enjo@@ y a decade of per capita income growth at least as high as that of the US.
Moreover, with growing concerns about the sustain@@ ability of US fiscal policy, the euro has a huge opportunity to play a significantly larger role as a reser@@ ve curren@@ cy.
One sh@@ ud@@ ders to think what will happen if Europe does not pul@@ l out of its current f@@ unk@@ .
C@@ er@@ tain@@ ly, Europe would lose trac@@ tion as a b@@ adly needed counter@@ wei@@ ght to the US in world economic policy.
Europeans may not min@@ d this right now (@@ one se@@ es more Obama t-@@ sh@@ ir@@ ts in Europe than in the US@@ ), but they might not be so happ@@ y if a George Bush II@@ I comes al@@ on@@ g.
For@@ tun@@ ately, Europeans will probably not wa@@ it so long to start moving ahead again@@ .
O@@ ver the last two decades Europe experienc@@ ed a dramatic expansion of financial markets at the exp@@ ense of its traditional system of financing based on close relation@@ ships between large banks and established firm@@ s.
Since 198@@ 0 the rati@@ o of stock market capit@@ alization to GDP so@@ ared more than 1@@ 3@@ -@@ fol@@ d, while equity financing ro@@ se 16@@ -@@ fol@@ d.
In 198@@ 0, stock market capit@@ alization relative to GDP was five times greater in the US and U@@ K than in Con@@ tin@@ ent@@ al Europe@@ ; by 200@@ 0, it was only 60@@ % hig@@ her@@ . 
Dis@@ clos@@ ure standards improved throughout the Con@@ tin@@ ent, as did laws to protect min@@ ority sharehol@@ der@@ s.
For example, before 198@@ 0 no member of toda@@ y's European Union, exc@@ ept France and S@@ w@@ ed@@ en, had an anti-@@ insi@@ der trading law@@ --@@ and in S@@ we@@ den the law, although introduc@@ ed in 197@@ 1, was not en@@ forced for the first time until 1990@@ .
By 200@@ 0, all EU members had anti-@@ insi@@ der trading laws and most were en@@ forc@@ ing them. 
What caused this chan@@ ge@@ ?
Is it benef@@ iting all EU countries, and will it persi@@ st as EU enlar@@ gement proc@@ e@@ ed@@ s? 
R@@ el@@ ation@@ ship@@ -@@ based financial systems per@@ form better when markets and firms are sm@@ all@@ er, when legal protection is weak@@ er, there is little public inform@@ ation, and innov@@ ation is in@@ cre@@ ment@@ al.
Bank@@ s tend to have clos@@ e, long-@@ ter@@ m, and protec@@ tive ties with the manag@@ ers of such firm@@ s, pri@@ mar@@ ily because the bank@@ 's hol@@ d@@ ings are illi@@ qui@@ d.
This can provide consider@@ able stabilit@@ y-@@ -@@ indeed, the second half of the 20@@ th century saw only four German firms succ@@ um@@ b to hosti@@ le tak@@ e@@ over@@ s@@ --@@ but at the cost of reducing access to finance and cur@@ tail@@ ing future opportuni@@ ties. 
By contrast, market@@ -@@ based financial systems per@@ form better when economies and firms are big@@ ger and more form@@ ally organiz@@ ed, with better legal en@@ forc@@ ement and transpar@@ enc@@ y, and when innov@@ ation is con@@ stan@@ t.
A market@@ -@@ based system gi@@ ves new firm@@ s@@ --@@ h@@ ence new technologi@@ es@@ --@@ more chan@@ ces to ob@@ tain financ@@ ing, because many investors ass@@ ess firms in@@ depend@@ ent@@ ly. 
But financial systems do not emer@@ ge as a result of their sup@@ eri@@ ority in a particular environ@@ ment.
V@@ est@@ ed interests dist@@ ort the process of ev@@ olu@@ tion.
O@@ ver the last deca@@ de, trade liber@@ alization and monetary integration supported the expansion of market@@ -@@ based financing in Europe. 
Trade integration ex@@ posed domestic banks and firms to foreign competi@@ tion, limit@@ ing national government@@ s@@ ' ability to interven@@ e on be@@ half of favor@@ ed domestic compani@@ es.
Similarly, the European Commission de@@ em@@ ed subsi@@ dies to publi@@ cl@@ y-@@ owned firms il@@ legal if they di@@ stor@@ ted competition across member states, while the fiscal discipl@@ ine imposed by the Euro ended per@@ v@@ asi@@ ve general government credit subsi@@ dies@@ --@@ the essential l@@ ub@@ ri@@ c@@ ant of relation@@ ship@@ -@@ based system@@ s. 
Moreover, the volum@@ e of corporate debt securi@@ ties almost tri@@ pl@@ ed after the introduc@@ tion of the Euro elimin@@ ated exchan@@ ge-@@ rate risk@@ .
The European Commission also op@@ ened up the market for corporate control by v@@ et@@ o@@ ing the barri@@ ers against hosti@@ le tak@@ e@@ over@@ s that most EU governments had er@@ ec@@ ted. 
But now that Europe's internal economic bo@@ und@@ aries have been mostly remo@@ v@@ ed, and the political objec@@ tive has shif@@ ted to political uni@@ fic@@ ation, integration may no longer be so market@@ -@@ friend@@ ly.
The more political power is cent@@ rali@@ z@@ ed, the more the central authority can inter@@ f@@ ere with market development.
The pro-@@ market bi@@ as that character@@ ized EU policy up to now (@@ with no@@ table excep@@ tions, such as agricultural policy@@ ) may well shift in the opposi@@ te direc@@ tion. 
In trade zon@@ es form@@ ed by he@@ ter@@ o@@ gene@@ ous states, v@@ est@@ ed interests tend to be di@@ verse and find it hard to lob@@ by at the sup@@ ran@@ ational level@@ .
Politi@@ cal integra@@ tion, by contrast, might have an opposi@@ te effect on the development of markets.
The threat of capital f@@ light to ne@@ ar@@ by political enti@@ ties cre@@ ates a strong incen@@ tive to keep policies market@@ -@@ friend@@ ly, but it is sup@@ pressed when neighbor@@ ing political enti@@ ties co@@ al@@ es@@ ce. 
In@@ cum@@ b@@ ent financi@@ ers, mean@@ while, have a powerful v@@ est@@ ed interest in op@@ posing a market@@ -@@ based system, which favor@@ s credit ev@@ al@@ u@@ ation and risk management over their main ``@@ skill@@ '@@ '@@ : being well connec@@ ted.
They also have the ability to organi@@ ze success@@ fully against the market, particularly in small countries, where inc@@ um@@ b@@ ents form a well-@@ defin@@ ed group whose members often atten@@ ded the same eli@@ te school@@ s, frequ@@ ent the same cl@@ ub@@ s, and inter@@ mar@@ r@@ y. 
The question is not whether Europe should move toward a market@@ -@@ based financial system. The real question is whether Europe re@@ tains the political will to continue to do so, and whether EU countries can strengthen the institutions necessary to rea@@ p the full benefits of financial markets. 
There is a serious danger that reforms that facilit@@ ate markets will benefit nor@@ thern Europe but har@@ m under@@ developed regions in southern Europe by de@@ pri@@ ving them of the relation@@ ship@@ -@@ based system.
In these region@@ s, higher rates of corruption and tax ev@@ a@@ sion, together with smaller average fir@@ m si@@ z@@ e, undermin@@ e the production of credi@@ ble information that financial markets ne@@ ed. 
Par@@ tly for this reas@@ on, EU enlar@@ gement is sup@@ eri@@ or@@ --@@ at least for financial market@@ s@@ --@@ to political uni@@ fic@@ ation, which encoura@@ ges v@@ est@@ ed interests to lob@@ by at the central level@@ .
Indeed, one benefit of the European Commission@@ 's rule that some decisions must be un@@ anim@@ ous is that its imp@@ ed@@ es the exerc@@ ise of mon@@ opol@@ y power, thus reducing the risk that cent@@ rali@@ zed authority will be used against markets. 
This is all the more important because leaders in both the US and Europe are beginning to p@@ ander to the anti-@@ globalization movem@@ ent.
America's corporate sc@@ and@@ als have undermin@@ ed the market@@ 's moral stand@@ ing, while the end of the Internet bub@@ ble has weak@@ ened its economic credi@@ bilit@@ y.
The ad@@ verse distribu@@ tive effects of market@@ -@@ based finance may serve to further strengthen anti-@@ market forces in Europe, especially in southern Europe. 
The EU can bu@@ ck this anti-@@ market tren@@ d by promoting structural reforms in southern European countries and foc@@ uss@@ ing on enlar@@ gement to increase economic competi@@ tion.
But it should maintain a clear divi@@ sion of power between local and central authorities at all levels to maintain strong competition and a health@@ y diversi@@ ty of interest@@ s. 
Am@@ ong the many surpri@@ ses during the Republican Party presidential candid@@ at@@ es’ deb@@ ates a cou@@ ple of week@@ s ago was the rek@@ in@@ d@@ led importance of immig@@ ra@@ tion.
After the failure of President George W. Bush’s and Sen@@ ator E@@ d@@ ward Kenn@@ ed@@ y’s comprehensive immig@@ ration reform effort last spr@@ ing, most obser@@ vers thought the matter would remain dor@@ man@@ t until 2009, since even tou@@ ching it was potentially f@@ at@@ al for Democ@@ rats and Republi@@ c@@ ans ali@@ k@@ e.
But as Democ@@ rats dis@@ cover@@ ed in other recent deb@@ at@@ es, and as Republi@@ c@@ ans re@@ alized with a little help from the C@@ N@@ N organiz@@ ers, who s@@ ke@@ w@@ ed the questions toward issues they feel stron@@ gly ab@@ out, immig@@ ration is an issue that just won@@ ’t go a@@ way.
This is one reason why I w@@ ro@@ te a short but – I hope – us@@ eful book on Mexi@@ can immig@@ ration to the United States, enti@@ t@@ led Ex@@ -@@ Mex@@ : From Mig@@ rants to I@@ mm@@ ig@@ rants . Bas@@ ed on internal docum@@ ents from the Mexi@@ can and US government@@ s, coun@@ t@@ less inter@@ view@@ s, and a surv@@ ey of much of the existing liter@@ at@@ ure on the sub@@ jec@@ t, Ex@@ -@@ Me@@ x seek@@ s to ful@@ f@@ ill three pur@@ pos@@ es.
First, I wanted to provide a Mexi@@ can vo@@ ice in the immig@@ ration deb@@ ate.
Mexic@@ ans make up more than half of the f@@ low and stock – legal or not – of all immig@@ rants in the US, but a point of view attemp@@ ting to reflect their interests and as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions has been largely ab@@ sent from the American discus@@ sion.
Of course, my book cannot be the Mexi@@ can st@@ ance.
But an ass@@ ess@@ ment from the v@@ an@@ tage point of past@@ , curr@@ ent, and future Mexi@@ can immig@@ rants to the US is a necessary comp@@ on@@ ent of the American debate – all the more so when one rec@@ all@@ s that immig@@ ration h@@ as, in fact, not generally been exclu@@ si@@ vely a domestic US policy ques@@ tion.
The first American immig@@ ration agreement with another country was signed in 19@@ 0@@ 7 – the so-called G@@ ent@@ le@@ man@@ ’s A@@ gre@@ ement with Japan, while the US and Mexico negoti@@ ated and administ@@ ered the B@@ rac@@ er@@ o Progra@@ m for more than twent@@ y years, from 194@@ 2 th@@ r@@ u 196@@ 4.
And, of course, the US has had a standing immig@@ ration agreement since 196@@ 5 with a country most Americans would not imag@@ ine@@ : F@@ ide@@ l C@@ astro@@ ’s Cub@@ a.
Second, it is important to place the curr@@ ent, ra@@ ging debate in historical con@@ tex@@ t.
The most important feat@@ ure of that con@@ text is that the ac@@ tual f@@ low of Mexic@@ ans ent@@ ering the US today is not much greater than the overall average fig@@ ure for the B@@ rac@@ er@@ o Progra@@ m peri@@ od@@ : around 4@@ 00@@ ,000 per year.
It is simil@@ arly important to understand the ev@@ olution of US legisl@@ ation on immig@@ ration since the 19@@ 20@@ ’@@ s, and the shif@@ ts and hy@@ po@@ cri@@ s@@ y involved in the app@@ lic@@ ation of those law@@ s.
For example, the 199@@ 6 immig@@ ration reforms implement@@ ed by the Clinton administ@@ ration, along with o@@ ther, underlying structural tren@@ ds, hal@@ ted the traditional cir@@ cul@@ ar pat@@ tern wher@@ e@@ by Mexic@@ ans came and went to the US every year.
Instead, they began to sett@@ le in communi@@ ties far@@ ther from the bor@@ der, great@@ ly increasing the stock of Mexic@@ ans in the US.
Finally, the efforts of the Mexi@@ can and US governments since 2001 to reach an ac@@ com@@ mod@@ ation on the issue have not been well under@@ sto@@ od.
Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al pap@@ ers from the Bush and Fo@@ x administ@@ ra@@ tions show that talks went further than pre@@ viously know@@ n.
The US, and particularly th@@ en-@@ Secretary of State C@@ oli@@ n P@@ ow@@ ell, was will@@ ing, as st@@ ated in a un@@ classi@@ fied mem@@ o addres@@ sed to Bush in late August 2001, to go to great l@@ eng@@ th@@ s to reach an understanding with Mexico on the issu@@ e.
Indeed, the subst@@ ance of the negotiations was not much different from the con@@ tent of the Bush-@@ Kenn@@ ed@@ y “@@ gr@@ and bar@@ gain@@ ” that was fas@@ hi@@ oned in 200@@ 7.
The electoral numbers perhaps best explain the immig@@ ration equ@@ ation@@ ’s importance in today’s presidential campaig@@ n@@ s.
In 2008, it is likely that Lat@@ in@@ os will make up 9@@ % to 10% of the elector@@ ate, the highest share ever@@ .
They will wi@@ el@@ d deci@@ sive importance in s@@ wing states like Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o, New Mexico@@ , Fl@@ ori@@ da@@ , and N@@ ev@@ ad@@ a.
Ha@@ ving made significant in@@ road@@ s among His@@ pan@@ ic voters in 2000 and 200@@ 4, th@@ anks to Bush’s support for immig@@ ration reform@@ , Republi@@ c@@ ans now can bar@@ ely coun@@ t on 20% of that total – mainly among Cub@@ an-@@ Americans – th@@ anks to their stri@@ dent anti-@@ immig@@ ration st@@ ance.
Thus, if the Democ@@ rats demon@@ st@@ rate a minim@@ um of comp@@ as@@ sion, sensi@@ tiv@@ ity, and re@@ alism, they can coun@@ t on a 7% advantage in the popular vo@@ te.
But doing so could cost Democ@@ rats de@@ arly in old industrial states like P@@ enn@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ani@@ a, O@@ hi@@ o, and Mich@@ ig@@ an, where the ar@@ ri@@ val of Mexi@@ can mig@@ ran@@ ts, transform@@ ed into immig@@ ran@@ ts, has st@@ ok@@ ed pas@@ sions.
Since the Democ@@ rat@@ s’ victory will most likely depend on these states, the Democratic candidate who can squ@@ are this cir@@ cle@@ , or the Republican who can break it, may well win the presiden@@ cy.
B@@ E@@ I@@ J@@ IN@@ G – F@@ ut@@ ure history book@@ s, dep@@ ending on where they are w@@ rit@@ ten, will take one of two approach@@ es to as@@ sig@@ ning blam@@ e for the world’s current financial and economic crisis.
One approach will blam@@ e la@@ x regul@@ ation, ac@@ com@@ mod@@ ating monetary policy, and in@@ adequate savings in the United Stat@@ es.
The o@@ ther, already being push@@ ed by former and current US officials like Al@@ an Greensp@@ an and B@@ en Bernank@@ e, will blam@@ e the immen@@ se po@@ ol of liquidity gener@@ ated by high-@@ savings countries in East Asia and the Middle East@@ .
All that liquidi@@ ty, they will argu@@ e, had to go some@@ wher@@ e@@ .  Its logi@@ cal dest@@ in@@ ation was the country with the deep@@ est financial markets, the US, where it raised asset prices to un@@ sustainable hei@@ gh@@ ts.
No@@ te the one thing on which members of both camp@@ s agre@@ e: the global savings im@@ balance – low savings in the US and high savings in China and other emerging markets – played a key role in the crisis by allow@@ ing Americans to live beyond their mean@@ s.
It encoura@@ ged financi@@ ers des@@ per@@ ate to ear@@ n a return on ab@@ und@@ ant funds to put them to more specul@@ ative us@@ e.
If there is a consensus on one issu@@ e, it is the im@@ possibility of understanding the bub@@ ble and the cra@@ sh without consider@@ ing the role of global im@@ balanc@@ es.
Pre@@ v@@ enting future crises similar to this one therefore requires resol@@ ving the problem of global im@@ balanc@@ es.
Her@@ e, the early sig@@ ns are re@@ ass@@ ur@@ ing.
American households are saving again@@ .
The US trade deficit has decl@@ ined from $@@ 60 billion a month to just $@@ 2@@ 6 billi@@ on, according to the most recent dat@@ a.
As a matter of simple ari@@ th@@ me@@ tic@@ , we know that the rest of the world is running cor@@ respon@@ d@@ ingly smaller surpl@@ us@@ es.
But once American households re@@ build their reti@@ re@@ ment accoun@@ ts, they may return to their prof@@ lig@@ ate way@@ s.
Indeed, the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve are doing all they can to p@@ um@@ p up US spend@@ ing.
The only reason the US trade deficit is falling is that the country remains in a severe recession@@ , caus@@ ing US impor@@ ts and exports to collapse in par@@ all@@ el@@ .
With recover@@ y, both may reco@@ ver to previous level@@ s, and the 6@@ %@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ GDP US external deficit will be back@@ .
In fact, there has been no change in relative prices or de@@ preci@@ ation of the US dollar of a mag@@ nit@@ u@@ de that would au@@ gu@@ r a permanent shift in trade and spending pat@@ tern@@ s.
W@@ he@@ ther there is a permanent reduction in global im@@ balances will depend mainly on decisions taken outside the US, speci@@ fic@@ ally in countries like China.
O@@ ne@@ ’s forec@@ ast of those decisions h@@ ing@@ es, in tur@@ n, on why these other countries came to run such large surpl@@ uses in the first plac@@ e.
One view is that their surpl@@ uses were a cor@@ oll@@ ary of the policies favor@@ ing export@@ -@@ led growth that worked so well for so lon@@ g.  @@ China’s leaders are understand@@ ably rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ant to aband@@ on a tri@@ ed-@@ and@@ -@@ true model@@ .
They can@@ ’t restruc@@ ture their economy inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ous@@ ly.
They can@@ ’t move workers from pain@@ ting chil@@ d@@ ren@@ ’s to@@ ys in Gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong to building school@@ s in Western China over@@ ni@@ gh@@ t.
They need time to build a social safety net capable of encoura@@ ging Chinese households to reduce their prec@@ au@@ tionary sav@@ ing.
If this view is correc@@ t, we can expect to see global im@@ balances re-@@ emer@@ ge once the recession is over and to un@@ win@@ d only slow@@ ly there@@ af@@ ter.
The other view is that China contribut@@ ed to global im@@ balances not through its mer@@ chan@@ di@@ se export@@ s, but through its capital export@@ s.
What China lack@@ ed was not demand for consumption good@@ s, but a supply of high-@@ quality financial asset@@ s.
It found these in the US, mainly in the form Treasury and other government@@ -@@ backed securi@@ ties, in turn push@@ ing other investors into more specul@@ ative invest@@ ments.
Rec@@ ent events have not enh@@ anced the stat@@ ure of the US as a supp@@ lier of high-@@ quality asset@@ s.
And China, for its par@@ t, will continue to develop its financial markets and its capacity to generate high-@@ quality financial assets intern@@ ally.
But doing so will take time.
Meanwhile, the US still has the most li@@ qui@@ d financial markets in the world.
This interpre@@ tation again implies the re-@@ emer@@ gence of global im@@ balances once the recession end@@ s, and their very gradu@@ al un@@ win@@ ding there@@ af@@ ter.
One development that could change this forec@@ ast is if China comes to view invest@@ ing in US financial assets as a mone@@ y-@@ los@@ ing pro@@ posi@@ tion.
US budget deficits as far as the ey@@ e can see might exc@@ ite fear of losses on US Treasury bond@@ s.
A de fac@@ to policy of infl@@ ating away the debt might st@@ ok@@ e such fear@@ s fur@@ ther.
At that poin@@ t, China would pul@@ l the pl@@ u@@ g, the dollar would cra@@ sh@@ , and the Fed would be forced to raise interest rates, pl@@ ung@@ ing the US back into recession@@ .
There are two hop@@ es for avo@@ iding this disa@@ stro@@ us out@@ come.
One is rel@@ ying on Chinese good@@ will to stabili@@ ze the US and world economies.
The other is for the Obama administration and the Fed to provide de@@ tail@@ s about how they will elimin@@ ate the budget deficit and avoid inflation once the recession end@@ s.
The second op@@ tion is clearly prefer@@ able.
After all, it is always better to control one’s own f@@ ate.
CAMBRIDGE – When the financial crisis of 2008 h@@ it, many shock@@ ed critic@@ s asked why markets, regul@@ ator@@ s, and financial exper@@ ts failed to see it com@@ ing.
Today, one might ask the same question about the global econom@@ y’s vulner@@ ability to cy@@ ber@@ -@@ attack@@ .
Indeed, the par@@ all@@ els between financial crises and the threat of cy@@ ber mel@@ t@@ dow@@ ns are strik@@ ing.
Although the greatest cy@@ ber threat comes from ro@@ gue states with the capacity to develop extrem@@ ely s@@ op@@ h@@ istic@@ ated compu@@ ter vi@@ rus@@ es, risks can also come from an@@ arch@@ is@@ tic h@@ ack@@ ers and terror@@ ist@@ s, or even from compu@@ ter g@@ lit@@ ches com@@ po@@ unded by natural c@@ atastroph@@ e.
A few security exper@@ ts have vo@@ ic@@ ed great al@@ arm@@ , inclu@@ d@@ ing, most rec@@ ently, J@@ on@@ a@@ than E@@ v@@ ans, the head of the British Security Ser@@ vice (@@ M@@ I@@ 5@@ ).
By and lar@@ ge, however, few leaders are willing to com@@ promise growth in the te@@ ch sector or the Internet in any significant way in the name of a threat that is so am@@ or@@ p@@ hous@@ .
Instead, they pre@@ fer to establish relatively in@@ no@@ cu@@ ous working groups and task forc@@ es.
It is difficult to over@@ state the depen@@ dence of modern economies on lar@@ ge-@@ scale compu@@ ter system@@ s.
But imag@@ ine if one day a ho@@ st of key communic@@ ations sat@@ el@@ li@@ tes were in@@ capac@@ it@@ ated, or the dat@@ ab@@ as@@ es of major financial systems were er@@ as@@ ed.
Exper@@ ts have long identi@@ fied the electric@@ ity gri@@ d as the most ac@@ ute vulner@@ abilit@@ y, since any modern economy would collapse without power.
Tru@@ e, many skep@@ tics argue that with reason@@ able low-@@ cost pro@@ ph@@ y@@ l@@ ac@@ tic meas@@ ures, large scale cy@@ ber@@ -@@ mel@@ t@@ dow@@ ns are highly im@@ plausi@@ ble, and that do@@ om@@ -@@ mon@@ ger@@ s over@@ state the wor@@ st-@@ case scenari@@ o@@ s.
They say that the ability of cy@@ ber@@ -@@ terror@@ ists and bl@@ ack@@ ma@@ il@@ ers to take the global economy to the br@@ in@@ k, as in the 2007 Bru@@ ce W@@ illi@@ s mo@@ vi@@ e Die H@@ ard 4, is ut@@ ter@@ ly fic@@ tion@@ al.
It is difficult to jud@@ ge who is righ@@ t, and there are important exper@@ ts on both sides of the deb@@ ate.
But there do seem to be an un@@ com@@ for@@ table number of simil@@ ari@@ ties between the political economy of cy@@ ber@@ space regulation and of financial regul@@ ation.
First, both cy@@ ber@@ -@@ security and financial stability are extrem@@ ely complex top@@ ics with which government regul@@ ators can hardly keep up@@ .
In@@ dust@@ ry re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation for exper@@ ts is far in exc@@ ess of any public-@@ sector sal@@ ary, and the best min@@ ds are continu@@ ally bi@@ d a@@ way.
As a result, some argue that the only solution is reli@@ ance on self-@@ regulation by the so@@ ft@@ w@@ are indust@@ r@@ y.
One hear@@ s this argument for many modern industri@@ es, from big food to big p@@ har@@ ma to big finan@@ ce.
Second, like the financial sector@@ , the te@@ ch industry is enor@@ mo@@ us@@ ly influ@@ ential politically through contribu@@ tions and lob@@ by@@ ing.
In the United States, all presidential candidates must make p@@ il@@ gri@@ ma@@ ges to S@@ ili@@ c@@ on V@@ alle@@ y and other te@@ ch cent@@ ers to raise mone@@ y.
Ex@@ c@@ essive financi@@ al-@@ sector influence w@@ as, of course, a ro@@ ot cause of the 2008 mel@@ t@@ down and remains deeply implic@@ ated in today’s continuing eurozone m@@ ess.
Thir@@ d, with slow@@ ing growth in advanced economies, information technology seems to hold the moral high ground@@ , just as finance did until five years ago.
And cru@@ de attemp@@ ts by governments to en@@ force regulation are likely to prove in@@ effective in protec@@ ting against c@@ atastroph@@ e, while all too effective in stran@@ gl@@ ing growth.
In both cases – financial stability and cy@@ ber security – the risk of con@@ ta@@ gi@@ on cre@@ ates a situation in which a w@@ ed@@ ge can form between private incentives and social risk@@ s.
Ad@@ mit@@ ted@@ ly, progress in the technology sector overall often produ@@ ces huge soci@@ al-@@ welfare gain@@ s, which argu@@ ably out@@ stri@@ p those produced by all other sec@@ tors in recent decades.
But, just as with nuclear power pl@@ ant@@ s, progress can go aw@@ ry in the absence of good regul@@ ation.
Finally, the greatest risks come from ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ ce and ignor@@ ance, two human character@@ istic@@ s at the heart of most financial cri@@ ses.
Rec@@ ent re@@ vel@@ ations about the super@@ -@@ vi@@ rus@@ es “@@ Stu@@ x@@ net@@ ” and “@@ F@@ lam@@ e” are particularly dis@@ conc@@ er@@ t@@ ing.
These vi@@ rus@@ es, appar@@ ently developed by the US and Israel to dis@@ rup@@ t Iran’s nuclear progra@@ m, em@@ body a level of s@@ op@@ h@@ istic@@ ation far beyond anything pre@@ viously se@@ en.
Both are deeply enc@@ r@@ yp@@ ted and difficult to de@@ tec@@ t once in@@ side a compu@@ ter.
The F@@ lam@@ e vi@@ ru@@ s has the capacity to take over a compu@@ ter@@ ’s peripher@@ als, record Sk@@ yp@@ e con@@ vers@@ ations, take p@@ ic@@ tures through a compu@@ ter@@ ’s c@@ am@@ er@@ a, and trans@@ mit information via B@@ lu@@ et@@ o@@ o@@ th to any ne@@ ar@@ by de@@ vic@@ e.
If the world’s most s@@ op@@ h@@ istic@@ ated governments are developing compu@@ ter vi@@ rus@@ es, what guarantee is there that something won@@ ’t go aw@@ r@@ y?
How can we be s@@ ure that they won@@ ’t “@@ es@@ cap@@ e” and inf@@ ect a much broader class of system@@ s, or be adopted for other us@@ es, or that future ro@@ gue states or terror@@ ists won@@ ’t find a way to turn them on their cre@@ ator@@ s?
No economy is more vulnerable than the US, and it is ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ ce to believe that US cy@@ ber sup@@ eri@@ ority (@@ to all exc@@ ept perhaps Chin@@ a@@ ) provides it with imp@@ en@@ et@@ ra@@ ble security from attack@@ .
Un@@ fortun@@ ately the solution is not so simple as just building better anti-@@ vi@@ ru@@ s program@@ s.
Vi@@ ru@@ s protection and vi@@ ru@@ s development constitu@@ te an un@@ even arms rac@@ e.
A vi@@ ru@@ s can be just a cou@@ ple hund@@ red lines of compu@@ ter co@@ de, compared to hundreds of thousands of lines for anti-@@ vi@@ ru@@ s program@@ s, which must be designed to de@@ tec@@ t wide cl@@ ass@@ es of enem@@ i@@ es.
We are told not to wor@@ ry about lar@@ ge-@@ scale cy@@ ber mel@@ t@@ down@@ s, because n@@ one has occur@@ re@@ d, and governments are being vi@@ gi@@ lan@@ t.
Unfortunately, another lesson of the financial crisis is that most politicians are con@@ gen@@ it@@ ally in@@ capable of making difficult choic@@ es until risks actually materi@@ aliz@@ e.
L@@ et us hope that we are lu@@ ck@@ y for a while lon@@ ger.
W@@ AS@@ HI@@ NG@@ T@@ ON@@ , D@@ C – Tradi@@ tion@@ ally, “@@ you should go to the IMF@@ ” was not something you would say to friend@@ ly neighbor@@ s and close alli@@ es.
O@@ ver the past few decades, the International Monetary Fund became associated with excessive fiscal auster@@ ity, extreme political in@@ sensi@@ tiv@@ ity, and – since the Asian financial crisis of 199@@ 7-@@ 1998 – with an out@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ out sti@@ g@@ ma@@ .
Coun@@ tries borrow@@ ed from the IMF only under dur@@ ess, when all el@@ se failed – and when there was simply no other way to pay for essential import@@ s.
(@@ For I@@ cel@@ and in the fall of 2008, for example, the only alternative to IMF financing was to e@@ at lo@@ cally ob@@ tain@@ ed good@@ s, which mostly means fis@@ h@@ .)
But the IMF has changed a great deal in recent years, largely under the au@@ sp@@ ic@@ es of D@@ om@@ ini@@ que St@@ r@@ aus@@ s-@@ K@@ ah@@ n, its current man@@ aging direc@@ tor@@ .
St@@ r@@ aus@@ s-@@ K@@ ah@@ n, a former French finance minister and con@@ ten@@ der for the Soci@@ alist nomin@@ ation for the French presiden@@ cy, has push@@ ed through changes that allow the IMF to l@@ end without conditions in some circum@@ st@@ ances, and to give greater pri@@ ority to protec@@ ting social safety n@@ ets (@@ including unemployment benefits and health@@ care system@@ s@@ ).
He has also mo@@ ved the Fund deci@@ si@@ vely away from its ob@@ s@@ ession with fiscal auster@@ ity measures (@@ a big early mist@@ ake – with la@@ sting trau@@ mati@@ c consequences – in Indonesi@@ a and Korea in late 199@@ 7@@ ).
Greece und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly has serious problems today.
T he great opportunities offered by European integration have been largely squ@@ ander@@ ed.
And lower interest rates over the past decade – brought down to German levels through Greece being allow@@ ed, rather gener@@ ously, into the euro zone – led to little more than further deficits and a dangerous buil@@ du@@ p of government debt.
Germany and France – as de fac@@ to leaders of the European Union – are ha@@ g@@ gl@@ ing over a bel@@ ated support pack@@ age, but they have made it ab@@ und@@ antly clear that Greece must s@@ las@@ h public-@@ sector wages and other spend@@ ing.
Greek trade uni@@ ons know what this means – and are in the stre@@ et@@ s.
If Greece still had its own curren@@ cy, everything would be easi@@ er.
J@@ ust as in the case of the United King@@ dom since 2008, the Greek exchange rate would de@@ preci@@ ate shar@@ pl@@ y.
This would lower the cost of lab@@ or, restor@@ ing competi@@ tiveness (@@ as in Asia after 199@@ 7-@@ 9@@ 8@@ ) while also infl@@ ating asset prices and thereby helping bor@@ ro@@ wer@@ s who are under@@ water on their mortg@@ ages and other deb@@ ts.
But, with Greece and other troub@@ led euro@@ -@@ zone economies (@@ known to their de@@ trac@@ tors as the P@@ II@@ G@@ S@@ : Portug@@ al, I@@ rel@@ and, Ital@@ y, Greec@@ e, and Spain@@ ) having sur@@ ren@@ der@@ ed monetary policy to the European Central Bank (@@ EC@@ B@@ ) in Frank@@ fur@@ t, their curren@@ cies cannot fall in this fas@@ hi@@ on.
So Greece – and argu@@ ably the P@@ II@@ G@@ S more generally – are left with the need to cur@@ ta@@ il demand massi@@ vel@@ y, lower w@@ ag@@ es, and reduce the public-@@ sector work@@ forc@@ e.
The last time we saw this kind of pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ate fiscal auster@@ ity – when countries were ti@@ ed to the gold standard – it contribut@@ ed directly to the on@@ set of the Great Depression in the 193@@ 0’s.
This is a situation tail@@ or@@ -@@ made for St@@ r@@ aus@@ s-@@ K@@ ah@@ n and the “@@ new IMF@@ ” to ri@@ de to the res@@ cu@@ e.
Since early 2009, the Fund has had significantly greater resources to l@@ end to countries in troub@@ le, to c@@ us@@ hi@@ on the b@@ low of crisis, and to offer a form of international cir@@ cu@@ it@@ -@@ break@@ er when it looks like the ligh@@ ts might other@@ wise go out.
The idea is not to prevent necessary adjust@@ ments – for example, in the form of budge@@ t-@@ deficit reduction – but to spread them out over time, to restore confi@@ den@@ ce, and to serve as an external se@@ al of appro@@ val on a government’s credi@@ bilit@@ y.
T he IMF was created in the wan@@ ing days of World War II@@ , essen@@ tially as a United Stat@@ es@@ -@@ West European partner@@ ship.
Europe re@@ tains strong represent@@ ation at the Fund@@ , and has always cho@@ sen its top leader – in fact, most emerging markets (@@ in Asia, Latin America, and Afric@@ a@@ ) comp@@ la@@ in that Europe is over@@ repres@@ ented and has far too much say in how the Fund oper@@ at@@ es.
Yet at this moment of growing European crisis, while there is still time to ac@@ t, the Fund is con@@ fin@@ ed to the sid@@ el@@ in@@ es.
This is partly because German Chanc@@ ell@@ or Angel@@ a Merk@@ el, currently man@@ eu@@ ver@@ ing to ensure that a German is the next head of the EC@@ B@@ , does not want the Fund to become more involved in euro@@ -@@ zone policies.
The IMF might reason@@ ably take the position that ECB policies have been over@@ ly contrac@@ tionary – resulting in a strong euro and very low inflation – and are no longer appropriate for member countries in the mid@@ st of a financial collap@@ se.
If the IMF were to support Europe’s weak@@ er economies, this would challenge the prev@@ ail@@ ing ide@@ ology among Frank@@ fur@@ t-@@ domin@@ ated policy mak@@ ers.
But the real reason is much si@@ m@@ pl@@ er.
When French President Nicolas Sarkozy put forward St@@ r@@ aus@@ s-@@ K@@ ahn@@ ’s name to run the IMF@@ , he meant to par@@ k a past and potentially future ri@@ val in a far@@ away place about which people car@@ ed litt@@ le.
Th@@ en the global financial crisis h@@ it, and St@@ r@@ aus@@ s-@@ K@@ ah@@ n was pro@@ p@@ ell@@ ed to center sta@@ ge.
With Franc@@ e’s next presidential election fast approach@@ ing in 201@@ 2, the last thing Sarkozy now needs is for St@@ r@@ aus@@ s-@@ K@@ ah@@ n to play a stat@@ es@@ man@@ -@@ like role in saving the euro z@@ one.
We can expect to he@@ ar all kin@@ ds of mis@@ leading exc@@ uses from EU sources for exclu@@ ding the IMF@@ : “the Fund is too Americ@@ an@@ ,” “@@ Europe must resol@@ ve its own problem@@ s@@ ,” and “the IMF is not appropriate to our circum@@ st@@ anc@@ es@@ .” Given the mag@@ nit@@ u@@ de of the Greek crisis, they will all ring hol@@ low@@ .
Som@@ e@@ times history is driven by deep forces beyond our contro@@ l, and sometimes by she@@ er chan@@ ce.
And at other tim@@ es, like now, much that h@@ ang@@ s in the balance is affec@@ ted by the de@@ liber@@ ate, person@@ al, and short-term tac@@ tical consider@@ ations of people running for elec@@ tion.
The EU’s leaders will try hard to keep the IMF at b@@ a@@ y.
This is not good news for Greece – or for anyone who car@@ es about global financial stabilit@@ y.
CAMBRIDGE – Greece has b@@ ought some time with a new pack@@ age of financial suppor@@ t, but the country is not out of the wo@@ ods y@@ et.
It remains to be seen whether the sou@@ p@@ ed-@@ up auster@@ ity policies that Prime Minister George Pap@@ and@@ re@@ ou@@ ’s government has promised will prove to be politically accep@@ table and sustain@@ able.
Hist@@ ory suggests some ground@@ s for skep@@ tic@@ ism.
In a democracy, when the demands of financial markets and foreign credi@@ tors cl@@ ash with those of domestic work@@ ers, pen@@ sion@@ ers, and the middle cl@@ as@@ s, it is usually the loc@@ als who have the last sa@@ y.
Britain@@ ’s ex@@ it from the G@@ old Stand@@ ard in 193@@ 1 remains the historical land@@ mark@@ .
Ha@@ ving made the mist@@ ake of restor@@ ing par@@ ity with gold at a level that left the economy des@@ per@@ ately un@@ competi@@ tive, Britain strugg@@ led for several years with defl@@ ation and rising unemploy@@ ment.
Industri@@ es such as co@@ al, ste@@ el, and ship@@ building were hit har@@ d, and labor stri@@ fe became ra@@ mp@@ ant.
Even as unemployment reached 20@@ %, the Bank of Eng@@ land was oblig@@ ed to maintain high interest rates in order to prevent a massive out@@ f@@ low of g@@ ol@@ d.
E@@ v@@ ent@@ u@@ ally, increasing financi@@ al-@@ market pressure push@@ ed the country off gold in September 193@@ 1.
It w@@ as@@ n’t the first time that financial prob@@ ity had required the real economy to suff@@ er under the G@@ old Stand@@ ar@@ d.
What was different was that Britain had become a more democratic societ@@ y: the working class had become uni@@ on@@ iz@@ ed, the political fran@@ ch@@ ise had expan@@ ded fo@@ ur@@ fol@@ d since the end of World War I@@ , mass media publi@@ ci@@ zed ordinary peop@@ le’s economic p@@ ligh@@ t, and a soci@@ alist movement was wa@@ iting in the w@@ ings.
Despite their own in@@ stinc@@ ts, central bank@@ ers and their political ma@@ st@@ ers under@@ stood that they could no longer remain alo@@ of from the consequences of economic recession and high unemploy@@ ment.
Even more importantly, investors under@@ stood this, to@@ o.
As soon as financial markets begin to question the credi@@ bility of a government’s commitment to a fix@@ ed exchange rat@@ e, they become a force for inst@@ ability.
At the s@@ ligh@@ test hin@@ t of things going aw@@ ry, investors and deposi@@ tors pul@@ l up stak@@ es and move capital out of the country, thereby pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ating the collapse of the curren@@ cy.
This mo@@ vi@@ e was re@@ played in Argentin@@ a in the late 199@@ 0’s.
The lin@@ ch@@ p@@ in of Argentin@@ a’s economic strategy after 1991 was the Con@@ ver@@ ti@@ bility L@@ aw@@ , which leg@@ ally an@@ ch@@ or@@ ed the p@@ es@@ o to the US dollar at a one-@@ to-@@ one exchange rate and pro@@ hi@@ b@@ ited restric@@ tions on capital flow@@ s.
Argent@@ ine Econom@@ y Minister D@@ om@@ ing@@ o C@@ av@@ all@@ o en@@ vi@@ sion@@ ed the Con@@ ver@@ ti@@ bility La@@ w as both a har@@ ness and an eng@@ ine for the economy.
The strategy worked well initi@@ ally by bringing mu@@ ch@@ -@@ needed price stabilit@@ y.
But, by the end of the deca@@ de, the Argent@@ ine ni@@ gh@@ t@@ m@@ are had re@@ turned with a ven@@ ge@@ ance.
The Asian financial crisis and the Brazi@@ li@@ an de@@ valu@@ ation in early 1999 left the Argent@@ ine@@ an p@@ es@@ o looking deci@@ de@@ dly over@@ valu@@ ed.
D@@ ou@@ b@@ ts about Argentin@@ a’s ability to service its external debt multi@@ p@@ li@@ ed, confidence collap@@ s@@ ed, and before too lon@@ g, Argentin@@ a’s credi@@ t@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess s@@ li@@ d below that of some African countries.
U@@ l@@ tim@@ ately, what se@@ aled Argentin@@ a’s f@@ ate was not its leader@@ s’ lack of political will, but rather their in@@ ability to impose ever@@ -@@ more cost@@ ly policies on their domestic constitu@@ ents.
In fact, the Argent@@ ine government was willing to ab@@ ro@@ g@@ ate contrac@@ ts with virtually all domestic constitu@@ en@@ cies – public employ@@ e@@ es, pen@@ sion@@ ers, pro@@ vin@@ cial government@@ s, and bank deposi@@ tors – in order to meet its oblig@@ ations to foreign credi@@ tor@@ s@@ .@@ &#160;
But investors gre@@ w increasingly skep@@ tical that the Argent@@ ine con@@ gres@@ s, pro@@ vinc@@ es, and ordinary people would toler@@ ate the auster@@ ity policies needed to continue servic@@ ing foreign debt.
As mass protests spread@@ , they were pro@@ ved righ@@ t.
When globalization col@@ li@@ des with domestic politic@@ s, the sm@@ art money be@@ ts on the home te@@ am@@ .
Perhaps there is another pa@@ th.
Consider Lat@@ vi@@ a, which recently found itself experienc@@ ing economic difficul@@ ties similar to those of Argentin@@ a a decade ago.
Lat@@ via had grow@@ n rapidly since jo@@ ining the European Union in 200@@ 4, on the back of lar@@ ge-@@ scale external borrowing and a domestic property bub@@ ble.
It had run up a current-account deficit and a foreign-@@ debt burden that were liter@@ ally of Greek propor@@ tions.
Pre@@ dict@@ ab@@ ly, the global financial crisis and ab@@ rup@@ t re@@ vers@@ al in capital flows in 2008 left the Lat@@ vi@@ an economy in di@@ re stra@@ its.
As lending and property prices collap@@ s@@ ed, unemployment ro@@ se to 20% and GDP decl@@ ined by 18@@ % in 200@@ 9.
In Janu@@ ary 2009, the country had its worst rio@@ ts since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Lat@@ via had a fix@@ ed exchange rate and free capital flow@@ s, just like Argentin@@ a.
Its currency has been pe@@ g@@ ged to the euro since 200@@ 5.
Un@@ like Argentin@@ a, however, the country’s politicians managed to t@@ ough it out without de@@ valu@@ ing the currency and introduc@@ ing capital contro@@ l@@ s.
What seems to have changed the balance of political costs and benefits was the prospect of reach@@ ing the promised land of event@@ ual membership in the euroz@@ one, which comp@@ ell@@ ed Lat@@ vi@@ an policymakers to forec@@ lose any op@@ tions that would end@@ anger that objec@@ tive.
Th@@ at, in tur@@ n, increased the credi@@ bility of their actions – despite those ac@@ tion@@ s’ very high economic and political cost@@ s@@ .@@ &#160;&#160;@@ &#160; &#160;&#160;@@ &#160;
Will Greece be an Argentin@@ a or a Lat@@ vi@@ a@@ ?
The economics is not encoura@@ g@@ ing.
Un@@ less the Greek economy recover@@ s, taking on new debt is a temporary pal@@ li@@ ative that will require even more auster@@ ity down the lin@@ e.
And, as long as domestic demand remains de@@ press@@ ed, structural reforms – privati@@ zation and liber@@ alization of labor markets and profession@@ al services – are unlikely to deli@@ ver the needed growth.
As the experi@@ ences of inter@@ war Britain – and, more rec@@ ently, of Argentin@@ a and Lat@@ via – show@@ , it is the politics that ultimately determin@@ es the out@@ come.
For the Greek program to have any chan@@ ce, the Pap@@ and@@ re@@ o@@ u government must moun@@ t a mon@@ um@@ ent@@ al effort to con@@ vin@@ ce its domestic constitu@@ ents that economic pa@@ in is the price they are pa@@ ying for a b@@ righ@@ ter future – and not just a means to sati@@ sf@@ y external credi@@ tor@@ s.
W@@ AS@@ HI@@ NG@@ T@@ ON@@ , D@@ C –@@ For gener@@ ations to come, the Palestinians will re@@ member the hor@@ ri@@ fic war in Gaza with pa@@ in and bit@@ tern@@ ess.
But what cannot yet be seen is how Palestinians will view Ham@@ as.
W@@ he@@ ther Hamas can claim a victory – and whether Palestinians will believe them will be determined by the type of c@@ eas@@ ef@@ ire that is eventually agre@@ ed, if a form@@ al one is eventually agre@@ ed.
The end g@@ ame – for both Israel and Hamas – is thus cru@@ ci@@ ally import@@ ant.
For the mom@@ ent, Hamas is perceived by the majority of Palestinians as the vic@@ ti@@ m of a war inten@@ ded to gain its sur@@ ren@@ der.
After all, Hamas was democrati@@ cally elec@@ ted, but was for@@ b@@ id@@ den from ruling and bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed in Gaz@@ a.
At the same time, Palestinian President Mah@@ m@@ oud Abbas is acc@@ used of si@@ ding with Israel in order to restore his lost authority in Gaz@@ a.
The war ex@@ posed f@@ laws in Ham@@ as@@ ’ jud@@ g@@ ment.
Hamas appar@@ ently did not en@@ vision a ful@@ l-@@ scale confron@@ tation with Israel when it ref@@ used to rene@@ w a si@@ x@@ -@@ month tru@@ ce.
With Gaza suff@@ ering under a l@@ eng@@ thy si@@ e@@ ge, Hamas leader K@@ ha@@ li@@ d M@@ ash@@ al said that there was no point in a new tru@@ ce, since the old one had “@@ failed to li@@ ft the si@@ ege on Gaz@@ a@@ .”
Other leaders were quo@@ ted as sa@@ ying that Hamas would “@@ li@@ ft the si@@ ege by forc@@ e.”
If Hamas is to survi@@ ve the war, it must demon@@ st@@ rate that its resist@@ ance resul@@ ted in a permanent opening of Gaz@@ a’s border cros@@ sing@@ s, especially in R@@ af@@ ah@@ .
For Palestini@@ ans, these are sig@@ ns of vic@@ tor@@ y.
With open bor@@ ders, Hamas would secure its regime in Gaza and build its popul@@ arity in the West Bank, put@@ ting enormous pressure on Ab@@ bas@@ , the leader of the ri@@ val Fat@@ ah movem@@ ent, to accept a national unity government on terms set by Ham@@ as.
M@@ em@@ bers of Fat@@ ah@@ ’s Central Commit@@ tee are already acc@@ using Abbas of suppor@@ ting Israel in the figh@@ t@@ ing, of wan@@ ting to “@@ return to Gaza on an Israeli t@@ ank@@ .”
Radi@@ cal groups within Fat@@ ah are le@@ an@@ ing toward an open alliance with Ham@@ as.
If Hamas comes out ahe@@ ad, Ab@@ bas@@ ’s allies in other Palestinian fac@@ tions will press him to accept Hamas and Islamic Ji@@ had within the P@@ L@@ O@@ .
Egypt will have to back@@ tra@@ ck on its rejec@@ tion of Hamas in order to reco@@ ver its ima@@ ge among the Ara@@ bs and to reduce ten@@ sions within Egypti@@ an society.
Pres@@ s@@ ure to inte@@ gr@@ ate Hamas into Palestinian politics is also likely in some European capit@@ als, particularly Par@@ is and Lond@@ on, where some ex@@ pressed opposition to isol@@ ating Hamas even before the war.
But if Israel forces Hamas to accept its conditions for border contro@@ ls and a form@@ al c@@ eas@@ e@@ fi@@ re, Ham@@ as@@ ’s ima@@ ge as the gu@@ ardi@@ an of Palestinian resist@@ ance will be sever@@ ely dam@@ age@@ d.
Palestinians will ask if it was really necessary to fight this war and pay such a high pri@@ ce.
Abbas will be able to argue that he advis@@ ed Hamas to rene@@ w the tru@@ ce and to end its missi@@ le fir@@ e on Israeli to@@ w@@ n@@ s, but that Hamas insi@@ sted on ex@@ posing Palestinian civili@@ ans to dev@@ ast@@ ation.
One indic@@ ator to wat@@ ch for@@ : the l@@ eng@@ th of that c@@ eas@@ e@@ fi@@ re.
Palestinians will recognize Ham@@ as@@ ’s accep@@ t@@ ance of a multi@@ -@@ year tru@@ ce with Israel as a sign of defe@@ at, which would also under@@ s@@ core Palestinian feel@@ ings of hum@@ ili@@ ation and aband@@ on@@ ment.
Hez@@ boll@@ ah, despite its rhetor@@ ic@@ , has taken no steps to support Ham@@ as, and the Arab states seemed more than willing to support its defe@@ at.
It is in re@@ building Gaza that the stak@@ es of the competition will increas@@ e.
Ab@@ bas@@ , supported by the United States and the European Union, may have control over significant fund@@ ing.
The test for him will be to deli@@ ver quick@@ ly.
Hamas will also have resources for re@@ construc@@ tion.
Q@@ at@@ ar, a Hamas suppor@@ ter, has already announced an investment f@@ und for Gaza and contribut@@ ed $@@ 2@@ 50 milli@@ on.
Hamas will have to make a convinc@@ ing case that Gaz@@ a’s near destruc@@ tion is a price that had to be pa@@ i@@ d.
Many Palestinians believe that Israel inf@@ lic@@ ted this damage on Gaza to drive a w@@ ed@@ ge between the people and the “@@ resist@@ anc@@ e.”
There is a preced@@ ent for this argum@@ ent@@ : Hez@@ bollah descri@@ bed the destruc@@ tion of Bei@@ ru@@ t’s southern sub@@ ur@@ bs in exac@@ tly these terms at the end of the Leban@@ on War in Ju@@ ly 200@@ 6.
More importantly, Hamas can demon@@ st@@ rate that its leaders have been on the fron@@ t lines during this war, shar@@ ing Palestinian suff@@ er@@ ing@@ ; many have been k@@ il@@ le@@ d, along with their famili@@ es.
The biggest question is whether the war will alter Ham@@ as@@ ’ political go@@ als.
Two week@@ s ago, Mus@@ a Ab@@ u Mar@@ z@@ ou@@ k, a senior Hamas offici@@ al, p@@ raised J@@ im@@ my Car@@ ter in The L@@ os Angel@@ es Tim@@ es as the only American president who had brought true peace in the Middle East@@ .
This is a radical de@@ par@@ ture from Hamas rhetor@@ ic@@ , which has always por@@ tra@@ yed the Cam@@ p David agreement between Israel and Egypt as a betra@@ y@@ al of the Islamic world.
It remains to be seen whether Ab@@ u Mar@@ z@@ ou@@ k@@ ’s view is merely a tac@@ tic inten@@ ded to encourage the Obama administration to reach out to Ham@@ as, or whether the war convinc@@ ed Hamas that the two-@@ state solution is the only vi@@ able op@@ tion to sett@@ le the conflict with Israel.
PAR@@ I@@ S &#@@ 45@@ ;@@ &#@@ 45@@ ; F@@ e@@ w state visi@@ ts have la@@ sting resul@@ ts.
Nicolas Sarkoz@@ y’s just comple@@ ted tri@@ p to Washington may be an excep@@ tion, because the French President may be prepar@@ ing to bring NATO a highly valu@@ ed present for its 60@@ th anni@@ vers@@ ary in the spr@@ ing of 200@@ 9@@ : Franc@@ e’s return to NATO@@ ’s integ@@ rated military structu@@ re, from which Char@@ les de G@@ aul@@ le with@@ dre@@ w in 196@@ 6.
In re@@ tro@@ spec@@ t, de G@@ aul@@ le’s decision pro@@ ved to be much more de@@ tri@@ mental for France than for the Alli@@ ance.
By withdraw@@ ing from NATO@@ ’s integ@@ rated military comm@@ and, France exclu@@ ded itself from political decision@@ -@@ making within the Alli@@ ance and thus became the equi@@ valent of the “@@ H@@ ark@@ is@@ ”@@ – the local soldi@@ ers who ser@@ ved with the French army during the Al@@ geri@@ an war@@ : fin@@ e soldi@@ ers, but with virtually no re@@ ward for their servic@@ e.
How realisti@@ c is the possibility of scenari@@ o French return to NATO@@ ’s military fol@@ d@@ ?
Hist@@ or@@ ically, abor@@ ted mo@@ ves and f@@ au@@ x p@@ as abo@@ und on both sides in the Fren@@ ch@@ /@@ NATO relation@@ ship, the latest being J@@ acqu@@ es Chi@@ rac@@ ’s failed attempt to pat@@ ch up Franc@@ e’s relations with NATO upon his ar@@ ri@@ val in power in 199@@ 5.
Su@@ cc@@ ess is not guarante@@ ed this time, ei@@ ther, but the chan@@ ces are much higher now, because France, the United States, and the world have chan@@ ge@@ d.
For star@@ ters, the US now has a real fri@@ end and ally in the É@@ ly@@ s@@ é@@ e Pal@@ ac@@ e.
To spe@@ ak of Sarkozy as a sub@@ stitu@@ te for Tony Blair in Europe would be pre@@ mat@@ ure – and un@@ hel@@ pf@@ ul@@ , given Bla@@ ir@@ ’s in@@ ability to ex@@ ert significant influence on US policy.
But Sarkozy is both e@@ ager to trans@@ form Franc@@ e’s relations with the Alli@@ ance and has a strategy to do so.
Moreover, the French army suppor@@ ts such a mo@@ ve, while only a small se@@ g@@ ment of the Foreign Minist@@ ry is op@@ pos@@ ed.
Sarkoz@@ y’s strategy is to lin@@ k progress in building a common European defense and security structure with a re@@ defin@@ ition of NATO@@ .
More Europe in security terms means more Alli@@ ance.
So, because Sarkozy wants to be seen as a convinc@@ ed Europe@@ an, he must nor@@ mali@@ ze Franc@@ e’s relations with a new Alli@@ ance based on two p@@ il@@ lar@@ s – European and Americ@@ an.
Moreover, financial and human resources for military affair@@ s are scar@@ ce and cannot be du@@ p@@ lic@@ ated, while France and Britain want to res@@ tar@@ t the S@@ ain@@ t-@@ Mal@@ o process of bilateral defense efforts laun@@ ched nearly ten years ago.
As a result, for the s@@ ake of Europe, France must move closer to the Alli@@ ance.
Sarkozy has also fully integ@@ rated into Franc@@ e’s approach to Europe a reck@@ on@@ ing with the new balance of power within the European Union following the acc@@ ession of Eastern European states.
Un@@ like Chi@@ rac@@ , he under@@ stands that it is counter@@ productive and un@@ realisti@@ c to ask countries like B@@ ul@@ g@@ aria or Rom@@ ani@@ a to choose between their European or Atlan@@ tic loy@@ al@@ ties.
Her@@ e, again, strength@@ ening Europe requires strength@@ ening the Alli@@ ance.
Sarkoz@@ y’s approach may work, because America, too, has chan@@ ge@@ d.
In American ey@@ es, the Kosovo war in 1999 demonstrat@@ ed NATO@@ ’s g@@ lar@@ ing and my@@ ri@@ ad short@@ com@@ ings, while the terrorist attacks of September 1@@ 1, 2001, mo@@ ved America still further away from the Alli@@ ance, particularly after President George W. Bush di@@ spar@@ ag@@ ingly rejec@@ ted NATO@@ ’s offer of help@@ .
For@@ mer Secretary of Def@@ ense D@@ onald R@@ ums@@ feld even tried to use divi@@ de-@@ and@@ -@@ rule tac@@ tics by p@@ it@@ ting “@@ Ne@@ w@@ ” Europe against the “@@ O@@ l@@ d@@ ” Europe led by France and Germany, which op@@ posed the Iraq war.
Those divi@@ sions are now history, and American reser@@ v@@ ations about a European security p@@ ill@@ ar cannot tru@@ m@@ p America’s press@@ ing needs for alli@@ ed suppor@@ t.
Con@@ fron@@ ted with disa@@ ster in Iraq, the risk of Afghanistan following Iraq into cha@@ o@@ s, and the es@@ cal@@ ating crisis with Iran, the US can no longer tre@@ at the NATO allies with dis@@ da@@ in.
Although Europe remains milit@@ arily weak@@ , America’s power is now in dou@@ bt.
If a European p@@ ill@@ ar within NATO is needed to strengthen the Alli@@ ance, why not accept it@@ ?
Be@@ yond the changes in France and the US, the deci@@ sive factor behind the possible re@@ inv@@ en@@ tion of NATO is the transform@@ ation of the international system itself.
Asi@@ de from the explo@@ sive situation in the Middle East and the threat of Islamist terror@@ ism, the West is now confron@@ ted with the rise of Asia, the return of a more asser@@ tive Russia, and new energy and environmental challen@@ ges.
Both France and America have a key role to play in addres@@ sing these issues effec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y.
Sarkoz@@ y’s tri@@ p to Washingt@@ on, and his address to a rec@@ ep@@ tive US Con@@ gres@@ s, was one more step toward ens@@ uring that they do so toge@@ ther.
C@@ HI@@ CA@@ G@@ O – C@@ armen R@@ ein@@ hart and Kenn@@ eth Ro@@ go@@ ff@@ , in their exc@@ ell@@ ent, ep@@ on@@ y@@ mous book on debt cri@@ ses, argue that the most dangerous wor@@ ds in any langu@@ age are “@@ This time is differ@@ ent@@ .” Perhaps the next most dangerous wor@@ ds are “@@ N@@ ex@@ t time will be differ@@ ent@@ .”
These wor@@ ds are often ut@@ tered when politicians and central banks want to b@@ ail out some troub@@ led se@@ g@@ ment of the economy. “@@ Y@@ es@@ ,” one can almost he@@ ar them sa@@ y@@ ing, “@@ we understand that bail@@ ing out banks will sub@@ ver@@ t market discipl@@ ine.
But you cannot expect us to stand by and wat@@ ch the system collap@@ se, caus@@ ing millions of in@@ no@@ cent people to suff@@ er.
We have to live with the hand we are de@@ al@@ t.
But next time will be differ@@ ent@@ .” They then use every to@@ ol they have to prevent economic losses on their wat@@ ch.
The government’s incentives are cle@@ ar.
The public re@@ wards them for de@@ aling with the problem at hand – whether building le@@ ve@@ es to protect hous@@ es built on a flo@@ od pla@@ in or res@@ cu@@ ing banks that have do@@ d@@ g@@ y securi@@ ties on their balance she@@ et@@ s.
Politi@@ ci@@ ans and central bank@@ ers gain little by let@@ ting the gre@@ ed@@ y or car@@ eless face the full consequences of their ac@@ tions, for many in@@ no@@ cent people would suff@@ er as well.
A symp@@ a@@ the@@ tic press would amp@@ li@@ fy their hear@@ t-@@ ren@@ ding st@@ ories of lost jobs and hom@@ es, making those coun@@ sel@@ ing against intervention appear cal@@ lo@@ us.
Democ@@ ra@@ cies are necess@@ arily so@@ f@@ t-@@ hear@@ ted, whereas markets and nature are no@@ t; government inevit@@ ably exp@@ ands to f@@ ill the g@@ ap@@ .
To the extent that the rou@@ gh justice met@@ ed out by markets or nature teach@@ es anyone to be@@ have bet@@ ter, it has consequences far beyond the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on of anyone in power today.
When asked to choose between the risk of being known to po@@ ster@@ ity as the central bank@@ er who let the system collapse and the in@@ tan@@ gi@@ ble future benefits of teach@@ ing risk tak@@ ers a less@@ on, it does not take gen@@ i@@ us to predic@@ t the central bank@@ er@@ ’s deci@@ sion.
Democ@@ ra@@ cy ten@@ ds to institution@@ alize moral ha@@ z@@ ard in sec@@ tors that are economic@@ ally or politically import@@ ant, such as finance or real est@@ ate, allow@@ ing them to privati@@ ze gains and soci@@ alize los@@ ses.
Even though the authorities insi@@ st that the next time will be differ@@ ent, everyone knows that they will make the same decision when confron@@ ted with the same choice again@@ .
So, know@@ ing that next time will not be differ@@ ent, the authorities try their best to prevent a “@@ next ti@@ me@@ .”
But risk tak@@ ers have every incen@@ tive to try their lu@@ ck again, know@@ ing that, at wor@@ st, they will be bail@@ ed out.
In this cat@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ mo@@ use gam@@ e, risk tak@@ ers have the u@@ pp@@ er hand@@ .
For one th@@ ing, risk tak@@ ers are typ@@ ically sm@@ all, co@@ h@@ esi@@ ve interest groups that, once res@@ cu@@ ed, have a powerful incen@@ tive, as well as the resourc@@ es, to buy the political influence needed to ensure a return to the status qu@@ o an@@ te.
If risk tak@@ ers were allowed to face more serious los@@ ses, they would have fe@@ wer resources to fight political attemp@@ ts to constra@@ in their risk@@ y activi@@ ties.
Moreover, the public does not have a long mem@@ or@@ y, a long time h@@ ori@@ z@@ on, or an appe@@ ti@@ te for de@@ tail@@ .
Even as the United Stat@@ es’ volum@@ in@@ ous D@@ od@@ d-@@ Fran@@ k bil@@ l tried to ensure that bank@@ ers never sub@@ jec@@ ted American taxpay@@ ers to un@@ due risk again, public attention had mo@@ ved on to the state of the real economy and unemploy@@ ment.
Why focus on financial regulation when the risks of an immediate collapse are sm@@ all, and when the de@@ tail@@ s are so te@@ di@@ ous@@ ?
As techni@@ cal exper@@ ts and lob@@ by@@ ists took over, and the public lost interes@@ t, D@@ od@@ d-@@ Fran@@ k became friend@@ lier and friend@@ lier to the bank@@ s.
So how can this one-@@ way bet@@ ting be stopp@@ ed@@ ?
The sc@@ ary answer may be that it does not end until governments run out of money (@@ as in I@@ rel@@ and@@ ) or the public r@@ uns out of symp@@ ath@@ y (@@ as in Germany vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ v@@ is the rest of Europe@@ ).
To avoid that f@@ ate, governments should start by recogni@@ zing that the system is progra@@ mm@@ ed to respond to deep dist@@ res@@ s, and that they can do nothing about it.
But they must try to ensure that they do not destro@@ y incentives by doing too mu@@ ch.
And they must off@@ set the di@@ stor@@ tions created by intervention in other way@@ s.
For example, the US Federal Reserve has essen@@ tially guarante@@ ed the financial sector that if it ge@@ ts into troub@@ le, ul@@ tra@@ -@@ low interest rates will be maintain@@ ed (@@ at the exp@@ ense of sa@@ vers@@ ) until the sector recover@@ s.
In the early to mid-@@ 199@@ 0’s, rates were kept low because of bank@@ s’ re@@ al-@@ est@@ ate problems.
They were s@@ las@@ h@@ ed again in 2001 and kept ul@@ tra@@ -@@ low after the do@@ t-@@ co@@ m bu@@ st.
And they have been ul@@ tra@@ -@@ low since 2008@@ .
Sen@@ ior Fed policymakers den@@ y that their interest@@ -@@ rate policy be@@ ars any responsibility for risk tak@@ ing, but there is much evidence to the contr@@ ary.
It would be difficult for the Fed to respond differ@@ ently if the financial sector ge@@ ts into troub@@ le again@@ .
But it does not have to maintain ul@@ tra@@ -@@ low interest rates after the crisis has pass@@ ed, especially if those rates have little impact on gener@@ ating sustainable economic activ@@ ity.
Do@@ ing so merely re@@ wards banks for their past exc@@ esses – and taxes sa@@ ver@@ s.
More importantly, if the Fed wants to restore incentives for risk tak@@ ers and sa@@ ver@@ s, it should off@@ set the effects of sta@@ ying “@@ low for lon@@ g@@ ” in bad times by increasing interest rates more rapidly than is stri@@ c@@ tly necessary as the economy recover@@ s.
This will, of course, be politically difficul@@ t, because the public has been progra@@ mm@@ ed to think that ul@@ tra@@ -@@ low rates are go@@ od, and higher rates b@@ ad, for growth, without any consider@@ ation for the long-term sustain@@ ability of growth.
Finally, the pressure on governments to interven@@ e would be lower if individuals had access to a minim@@ um safety n@@ et.
Off@@ i@@ cial US policy is so activ@@ ist in down@@ tur@@ ns (@@ reg@@ ardless of its effec@@ tiven@@ ess@@ ) partly because unemployment is so cost@@ ly to workers – who have little sav@@ ings, unemployment benefits that run out quick@@ ly, and health care that is often ti@@ ed to a job@@ .
A stronger safety net for individuals might allow politicians to accept more corporate or financi@@ al-@@ sector dist@@ res@@ s, and help bol@@ ster their claim that next time really will be differ@@ ent.
After Israel’s in@@ ability last sum@@ mer to achieve a conclu@@ sive victory over Hez@@ bollah in southern Leban@@ on, public pressure forced Prime Minister E@@ hu@@ d O@@ l@@ mer@@ t’s government to ap@@ point a com@@ mission to exam@@ ine the causes of this surpri@@ sing fail@@ u@@ re.
How could a small m@@ ili@@ ti@@ a, num@@ ber@@ ing less than a few thous@@ and comb@@ at@@ ant@@ s, survi@@ ve the on@@ s@@ lau@@ ght of the Middle East@@ ’s most form@@ id@@ able military mach@@ ine@@ ?
The com@@ mission@@ , he@@ aded by reti@@ red Su@@ pre@@ me Court jud@@ ge Eli@@ y@@ ah@@ u Win@@ o@@ gra@@ d, has just publi@@ shed its inter@@ im repor@@ t.
Its critic@@ ism of O@@ l@@ mer@@ t, Def@@ ense Minister Am@@ ir Per@@ etz@@ , and Chi@@ ef@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ St@@ af@@ f D@@ an Hal@@ utz – set for@@ th in a de@@ tail@@ ed and me@@ ticul@@ ous 1@@ 17@@ -@@ p@@ age ass@@ ess@@ ment – is har@@ sh@@ , but not surpri@@ s@@ ing.
The Win@@ o@@ gra@@ d Commission ar@@ ticul@@ ated what most Israelis already think@@ : O@@ l@@ m@@ ert and Per@@ etz lack@@ ed the milit@@ ary, security, and policy experience to confron@@ t a terrorist organiz@@ ation that ra@@ ided Israeli terri@@ tor@@ y, killed a number of soldi@@ ers and k@@ id@@ n@@ app@@ ed two@@ , and then laun@@ ched thousands of ro@@ ck@@ ets on civilian targe@@ ts for over a mon@@ th.
Indeed, the in@@ experience of the prime minister and the defense minister are unpreced@@ ented in Israel’s histor@@ y.
O@@ l@@ mer@@ t, who step@@ p@@ ed into A@@ ri@@ el Shar@@ on’s sho@@ es as leader of the new Ka@@ di@@ ma Par@@ ty, was considered a comp@@ et@@ ent but l@@ ac@@ klu@@ ster parliament@@ arian – and later ma@@ y@@ or of Jer@@ us@@ alem – who was known more for his pol@@ em@@ ical style than for his political stat@@ ure or gra@@ vit@@ as.
For most Israeli@@ s, even those who voted for him as the be@@ ar@@ er of Shar@@ on’s leg@@ acy after the Gaza di@@ sen@@ ga@@ ge@@ ment, O@@ l@@ m@@ ert thus remained the ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ al prime minist@@ er.
Likewise, Per@@ etz@@ , a ra@@ b@@ ble@@ -@@ ro@@ using but effective trade uni@@ on@@ ist, surpri@@ sed all when he won the Lab@@ or Par@@ t@@ y’s leadership primary and then ch@@ ose the defense port@@ f@@ oli@@ o over the tre@@ as@@ ur@@ y.
To man@@ y, the du@@ o of O@@ l@@ m@@ ert and Per@@ etz seemed to inv@@ ite troub@@ le.
P@@ rec@@ is@@ ely because Israelis are aw@@ are of the con@@ st@@ ant security threat facing their country, they have always believed that their leaders should be able to lead Israel in war – but also to ask the military t@@ ough questions when diplom@@ acy may fail@@ .
When such a moment ar@@ ri@@ v@@ ed, tot@@ ally out of the bl@@ ue (or so it seem@@ ed@@ ) with Hez@@ boll@@ ah@@ ’s ra@@ id on Ju@@ ly 1@@ 2, 200@@ 6, Israel’s two top politicians were comple@@ tel@@ y out of their dep@@ th, st@@ um@@ bl@@ ing into a war for which neither they nor the Israeli Ar@@ my were prepar@@ ed.
The military was led – for the first time in its history – by an A@@ ir For@@ ce gener@@ al, D@@ an Hal@@ utz@@ , who believed that everything could be sol@@ ved by air power, creating a com@@ bus@@ ti@@ ble combin@@ ation of civilian ignor@@ ance and military ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ ce.
In measu@@ red but dev@@ a@@ stat@@ ing pro@@ se, the Win@@ o@@ gra@@ d Commission gi@@ ves fail@@ ing mark@@ s to all three leader@@ s.
O@@ l@@ m@@ ert decided to go into batt@@ le reck@@ less@@ ly and un@@ aw@@ are of the consequ@@ enc@@ es.
Per@@ etz was unable to g@@ au@@ ge the strategic implic@@ ations of his decision@@ s.
And Hal@@ utz failed to present the civilian leadership with the full pan@@ op@@ ly of military op@@ tions at the arm@@ y’s dis@@ pos@@ al.
Hal@@ utz already res@@ ig@@ ned a few months ago.
But both O@@ l@@ m@@ ert and Per@@ etz have declared that, despite the Commission@@ ’s conclu@@ sions, they would not qu@@ it@@ : inste@@ ad, they have vo@@ w@@ ed to imp@@ lement the re@@ port@@ ’s many f@@ ar-@@ reach@@ ing sub@@ stan@@ tive re@@ commen@@ d@@ ations about policy, strateg@@ y, and decision@@ -@@ making proc@@ ess@@ es.
Will O@@ l@@ m@@ ert and Per@@ etz be able to sta@@ y on@@ ?
Their coalition government enjo@@ ys a com@@ for@@ table parliamentary maj@@ or@@ it@@ y; nor does the political ari@@ th@@ me@@ tic imp@@ ly a vi@@ able parliamentary altern@@ ativ@@ e.
But public opinion – volati@@ le and an@@ gr@@ y – calls for both to res@@ ig@@ n@@ : a public-@@ opinion pol@@ l conduc@@ ted after the Commission publi@@ shed its report indic@@ ated that only 1@@ 4% of Israelis believe that O@@ l@@ m@@ ert should keep his job@@ , while less than 1@@ 1% support Per@@ etz@@ .
L@@ ater this week@@ , demon@@ stra@@ tions call@@ ing for the government@@ 's res@@ ig@@ nation are plann@@ ed, and it will become ob@@ viously more difficult for the government to continue to func@@ tion.
There are already ru@@ mor@@ s about a pal@@ ace cou@@ p within Ka@@ di@@ ma, aimed at re@@ plac@@ ing O@@ l@@ m@@ ert with either the dep@@ ut@@ y prime minister, the ve@@ ter@@ an Sh@@ im@@ on Per@@ es, or the popular foreign minister, T@@ zip@@ i Li@@ v@@ ni@@ .
But it does not appear that O@@ l@@ m@@ ert will allow himself to be push@@ ed out.
In fact, O@@ l@@ mer@@ t’s weak and dis@@ credi@@ ted government may yet survi@@ ve.
If the government were to fall and new elections hel@@ d, there are strong indic@@ ations that the winn@@ er might be B@@ in@@ y@@ am@@ in Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u@@ , of the righ@@ t-@@ wing Li@@ ku@@ d, which was deci@@ m@@ ated in the 2006 elec@@ tions, but is now pati@@ ently wa@@ iting in the w@@ ings.
Many who want O@@ l@@ m@@ ert to go would still not wel@@ come a Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u com@@ eb@@ ack@@ , which may also explain what appears to be an indi@@ rec@@ t end@@ or@@ s@@ ement of O@@ l@@ m@@ ert by the United Stat@@ es.
Only a strong Israeli government can make the pain@@ ful decisions necessary for negotiations with the Palestinians to succe@@ ed.
As a result, the prospec@@ ts for mean@@ ing@@ ful continu@@ ation of Israeli@@ -@@ Palestinian talks look even di@@ m@@ mer than they did befor@@ e.
Indeed, the real los@@ er of the 2006 Leban@@ on war was neither Israel nor Hez@@ boll@@ ah, bu@@ t, at least for the time bein@@ g, the peace process.
Inter@@ est rates around the world are po@@ is@@ ed to ri@@ se.
Sh@@ or@@ t-@@ term rates have gone so low since the worldwide recession of 2001 - 1% and 2@@ %, respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y, in the United States and the E@@ uroz@@ one, and practic@@ ally zer@@ o in Japan - that a strength@@ ening world economy will force central banks to ti@@ gh@@ ten the monetary rein@@ s.
Australi@@ a's central bank has already been raising rates since Ma@@ y 200@@ 2, and Great Britain@@ 's since November 200@@ 3.
In the US, the two-@@ day Federal Op@@ en Mark@@ et Commit@@ tee meeting on Jun@@ e 2@@ 9@@ -@@ 30 is likely to mark a major tur@@ ning poin@@ t, re@@ vers@@ ing the ste@@ ad@@ y decline of the ben@@ ch@@ mark federal funds rate since Al@@ an Greensp@@ an began lo@@ o@@ sen@@ ing monetary policy in 200@@ 1.
This is likely to be followed by rate increases in China, the E@@ uroz@@ one, and elsewher@@ e.
Given the tenden@@ cy of central banks to change interest rates gradu@@ ally, any change of direc@@ tion likely means more changes in the same direc@@ tion lat@@ er.
What will this land@@ mark change mean for prices of such assets as stock@@ s and hom@@ es?
In the@@ or@@ y, when interest rates go up@@ , there is reason to believe that asset prices will go dow@@ n.
The higher interest rates go@@ , the better are investments in bond@@ s, which compe@@ te with investments in other assets such as stock@@ s or hom@@ es.
H@@ igh@@ er interest rates also raise the cost of borrowing to buy these asset@@ s, which may dimin@@ ish demand for them, ex@@ er@@ ting down@@ ward pressure on their pric@@ es.
When interest rates fall@@ , the opposi@@ te effect on asset prices may be predic@@ ted.
In fact, the history of the stock market@@ 's re@@ actions to changing interest rates is mi@@ x@@ ed.
Som@@ e@@ times interest rate changes have the predic@@ ted effec@@ t, sometimes they don@@ '@@ t.
For example, the NA@@ S@@ D@@ A@@ Q stock price inde@@ x made a spec@@ tac@@ ular 1@@ 4% j@@ um@@ p up@@ wards on the day (@@ Janu@@ ary 3, 200@@ 1@@ ) when America's Fed began its latest seri@@ es of interest rate cut@@ s. A j@@ um@@ p in the market is what one might have expec@@ ted.
But then the NA@@ S@@ D@@ A@@ Q inde@@ x fell 2@@ 2% over the following year, although the Fed continued to cut interest rates aggressi@@ vel@@ y.
Do@@ es that experience suggest that the NA@@ S@@ D@@ A@@ Q inde@@ x will dro@@ p sharp@@ ly if the Fed rais@@ es interest rates on Jun@@ e 30@@ ?
No@@ .
The tim@@ ing of the 2001 rate de@@ creas@@ e st@@ un@@ ned the market.
By contrast, the Fed is widely expected to raise rates at the end this mon@@ th, so there will be no surpri@@ se el@@ em@@ ent.
The market may know@@ , not just from the experience of 200@@ 1@@ -@@ 2, that interest rate movem@@ ents do not have predict@@ able effects on stock pric@@ es.
But, there are reasons to believe that higher interest rates, even though expec@@ ted, can have a negative impact on home pric@@ es.
That is because home bu@@ y@@ ers are mostly ordinary people with little financial s@@ op@@ h@@ istic@@ ation, un@@ like the profession@@ als who trade in stock@@ s.
Un@@ tra@@ ined people with other things on their min@@ ds can make serious economic er@@ ror@@ s.
H@@ ome values have so@@ ared to high levels in many countries as ir@@ rational exu@@ ber@@ ance gri@@ ps the markets.
H@@ ig@@ h home prices are already put@@ ting great st@@ ress on many famili@@ es, which are stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing to make their mortg@@ age pay@@ ments.
When interest rates go up@@ , these pay@@ ments will (@@ when the rate is vari@@ able@@ ) also go up@@ , possibly becoming un@@ sustain@@ able.
If one bor@@ ro@@ ws the equi@@ valent of three year@@ s@@ ' income to buy a hous@@ e, a mortg@@ age rate of 6% means that 18@@ % of on@@ e@@ 's income goes to interest pay@@ ments, which may be toler@@ able.
But if the rate ris@@ es to 8@@ %, mortg@@ age interest pay@@ ments rise to 2@@ 4@@ %, wh@@ ich, together with am@@ or@@ tiz@@ ation, tax@@ es, other deb@@ ts, and necessary expendi@@ tur@@ es, may claim too much of the family budge@@ t.
Some will then try to sell their over@@ pric@@ ed hom@@ es, and the resulting market im@@ balance will cause prices to fall@@ .
People with fix@@ ed-@@ rate mortg@@ ages are also vulnerable to rate increas@@ es, though less direc@@ tl@@ y.
This is because if they have to move and sell their hous@@ e, there may be no bu@@ y@@ ers who can afford higher interest pay@@ ments, unless the hom@@ e@@ 's price also fall@@ s.
By contrast, s@@ op@@ h@@ istic@@ ated invest@@ ors, such as big stock market play@@ ers, are unlikely to fall pre@@ y to this tra@@ p@@ .
But hom@@ eb@@ u@@ y@@ ers are not as sav@@ v@@ y, so they may not see the change coming or they may fail to plan for it.
As psych@@ ologi@@ sts have show@@ n, people are sus@@ c@@ ep@@ ti@@ ble to "@@ wi@@ sh@@ ful thinking bi@@ as@@ ," wi@@ sh@@ ing away possible future problems that they would rather not think ab@@ out.
They may over@@ empha@@ size the lik@@ eli@@ hood of economic success (@@ "@@ I will be making a lot more money in a few year@@ s@@ "@@ ) and under@@ empha@@ size the com@@ mon@@ place problems that regul@@ arly challenge family budge@@ ts (@@ "@@ I will be los@@ ing my job or getting a di@@ vor@@ c@@ e@@ "@@ ).
This bli@@ the attitu@@ de is ultimately behind real est@@ ate bub@@ bl@@ es where they are oc@@ curr@@ ing.
L@@ ow interest rates did not cause the bub@@ bl@@ es. They only made it easier for people, in those areas of the world where there is a hal@@ f-@@ believ@@ able story about a f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous future economy, to in@@ dul@@ ge their fan@@ ta@@ si@@ es.
Inter@@ est rate increases will deli@@ ver a f@@ res@@ h do@@ se of re@@ alit@@ y: the interest exp@@ ense of ow@@ ning a home is going to claim a larger share of family budge@@ ts, a hard fact that will eventually sin@@ k into our think@@ ing.
But decl@@ ines in home prices will not occ@@ ur quickly when central banks begin to raise interest rates.
After two years of rate increas@@ es, Australi@@ a's home price boom only recently shows sig@@ ns of ab@@ at@@ ing.
D@@ omin@@ ated by am@@ at@@ eu@@ r invest@@ ors, home markets do not turn on a di@@ me.
In places where home prices have been rising rapid@@ ly, the up@@ ward tren@@ d may continue or level off for a whi@@ le.
In most high-@@ pric@@ ed plac@@ es, a real decline may not come for some time.
M@@ OS@@ CO@@ W – R@@ ap@@ id changes in the global economy and international politics are rais@@ ing, once mor@@ e, an e@@ ternal issue in Russi@@ a@@ : the country’s relations with Europe, and with the Euro@@ -@@ Atlan@@ tic region as a whol@@ e. Of course, Russia partly bel@@ on@@ gs to this region.
Y@@ e@@ ti@@ t cannot and does not want to join the West whol@@ eh@@ ear@@ tedly – at least not y@@ et@@ .@@ Meanwhile, this choice looks very different now compared to just a few years ago.
It is becoming obvious that the Euro@@ -@@ Atlan@@ tic world, whose economic and political model seemed so tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ant 20 years ago, is now lag@@ ging some@@ what behind China and other Asian countries. So is Russia, wher@@ e, despite encoura@@ ging talk about innov@@ ation@@ -@@ based development, the economy continues to de-@@ moderni@@ ze as corruption has been allowed to met@@ ast@@ asi@@ z@@ e, and as the country reli@@ es increasingly on its natur@@ al-@@ resour@@ ce weal@@ th.
Indeed, it is Asia that has turned out to be the true winn@@ er of the Cold War@@ .
These rising powers raise problems regar@@ ding Russia’s ge@@ o-@@ strategic choic@@ es@@ .@@ For the first time in decades, the values gap between Russia and the EU appears to be increas@@ ing. Europe is over@@ coming state nation@@ alism, while Russia is building a nation stat@@ e@@ .@@ Bro@@ ken by history and not wi@@ sh@@ ing to be ra@@ v@@ aged by war again, Europeans have emb@@ rac@@ ed com@@ promise and ren@@ oun@@ c@@ ed the direct use of force in international rel@@ ations.
Russi@@ ans, on the other hand, empha@@ size their “@@ hard power@@ ,” inclu@@ d@@ ing@@ military forc@@ e@@ ,@@ because they know that they live in a dangerous world and have no one to hi@@ de behin@@ d. And, because of the country’s compar@@ ative lack of “@@ soft power@@ ” – soci@@ al, cul@@ tur@@ al, and economic attrac@@ tiveness – it stands ready to@@ use the competitive adv@@ ant@@ ages (@@ i@@ .@@ e@@ ., its resour@@ ce weal@@ th@@ ) available to it.
In@@ ternal political develop@@ ments in Russia are also push@@ ing the country in a different direc@@ tion from the Wes@@ t. Qu@@ ite si@@ m@@ pl@@ y, Russia is moving away from democracy.
This emerging values gap is not an insur@@ moun@@ table ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le to geo@@ strategic rap@@ pro@@ chem@@ ent.
B@@ ut@@ ,@@ cou@@ pl@@ ed with mut@@ ual ir@@ rit@@ ation, which is particularly strong in Russia, clos@@ ing the gap is becoming much har@@ der.
For@@ , whi@@ le@@ Russia’s eli@@ te never considered itself defe@@ ated in the Cold W@@ ar, the West essen@@ tially tre@@ ated Russia as a defe@@ ated country – an attitu@@ de symboli@@ zed by NATO@@ ’s e@@ ast@@ ward expan@@ sion, which la@@ id a deep found@@ ation for ongoing ten@@ sion. It was only after the West en@@ counter@@ ed an armed re@@ bu@@ ff in South Os@@ se@@ ti@@ a that NATO expansion was stopp@@ ed in its tra@@ ck@@ s.
Yet NATO has not given up on further enlar@@ ge@@ ment.
NATO expansion is nothing more than the exten@@ sion of its zone of influence – an@@ di@@ n the most sensi@@ tive, milit@@ ar@@ y-@@ political sp@@ her@@ e. And yet the West@@ ’@@ sun@@ willingness to aband@@ on that effort is cou@@ pl@@ ed with a repe@@ ated ref@@ us@@ al to recognize Russia’s right to have its own zone of interes@@ t.
So NATO expansion has left the Cold War un@@ fin@@ ish@@ ed. The ideological and military confron@@ tation that under@@ la@@ y it is g@@ one, but the geo@@ political ri@@ val@@ ry that it ent@@ ail@@ ed has re@@ turned to the for@@ e.
Thus, the old ment@@ ality survi@@ ved on both sid@@ es.
En@@ erg@@ y deb@@ ates are another example of this.
N@@ on-@@ Russian Europe should th@@ ank the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty for the presence of energ@@ y-@@ rich Russia at its bor@@ ders, while Russia should be th@@ ank@@ ful for having such weal@@ thy custom@@ ers. But the natural differences in the interests of energy consum@@ ers and produc@@ ers have been given a politic@@ al@@ /@@ security t@@ wi@@ st – witn@@ ess the discus@@ sions about an “@@ En@@ erg@@ y NATO@@ .”
Fac@@ ed with the im@@ possibility of advan@@ ta@@ ge@@ ous acc@@ ession to Euro@@ -@@ Atlan@@ tic institutions, Russia is dri@@ f@@ ting fast towards ali@@ gn@@ ment with China – a “@@ yo@@ ung@@ er bro@@ ther@@ ,” though a respec@@ ted one. Russia’s “@@ Asian choic@@ e” of today is not the same as the S@@ la@@ v@@ op@@ hi@@ le@@ /@@ E@@ u@@ ra@@ si@@ an choice of the past@@ .
On the sur@@ fac@@ e, it looks like a choice in favor of a rapidly rising civili@@ z@@ ation.
But the current est@@ ran@@ gement from Europe – the cra@@ d@@ le of Russian civili@@ zation and moderni@@ zation – threat@@ ens Russia’s identi@@ ty and will increase its geo@@ strategic risks in the future.
Europe does not benefit from this est@@ ran@@ gement ei@@ ther.
It will continue to move towards be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful deca@@ y – V@@ en@@ ice wri@@ t lar@@ ge.
The United States also los@@ es. Without Russia, which will remain the world’s third stron@@ gest power for the for@@ es@@ ee@@ able futu@@ re, it is impossible to solve the key problems of international security.
The current Euro@@ -@@ Atlan@@ tic security arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture seems to su@@ it the majority of Americans and Europe@@ ans, though it is becoming increasingly fragi@@ le and counter@@ produc@@ tiv@@ e@@ .@@ So Russia will struggle to create a new arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture largely on its own – whether through a new treaty on collective European security, or even through its acc@@ ession to NATO@@ . This is not only in Russian political and civili@@ z@@ ational interes@@ t, but it also reflects our d@@ ut@@ y to the entire community of Euro@@ -@@ Atlan@@ tic nation@@ s, which is being weak@@ ened by the “@@ un@@ fin@@ ished Cold War@@ .”
The idea of a “@@ Union of Europe@@ ” between Russia and the EU should be put on the long-term agenda@@ .
That Union should be based on a common hum@@ an, economic@@ , and energy sp@@ ac@@ e. The combin@@ ation of a new security arran@@ gement for the Euro@@ -@@ Atlan@@ tic community and the establish@@ ment of the Union of Europe could ar@@ rest the decline in the international wei@@ ght of the Wes@@ t.
R@@ I@@ O D@@ E J@@ A@@ NE@@ I@@ R@@ O – Brazi@@ l has been making international head@@ lines of lat@@ e, but not for traditional st@@ ories about urban viol@@ ence, natural c@@ atastroph@@ es, political corrup@@ tion, or de@@ for@@ est@@ ation in the A@@ ma@@ z@@ on.
At the G-20 Sum@@ mit in London last Apri@@ l, for example, US President Barack Obama called for the world to pay he@@ ed to Brazi@@ li@@ an President Lu@@ i@@ z In@@ á@@ ci@@ o L@@ ula da S@@ il@@ v@@ a, the “@@ most popular politici@@ an on ear@@ th@@ ,” and sho@@ ok hands with him@@ , sa@@ y@@ ing@@ : “@@ M@@ y man right her@@ e.
I lo@@ ve this gu@@ y@@ .”
In Septem@@ ber, the ou@@ sted president of H@@ on@@ du@@ ra@@ s, Man@@ u@@ el Z@@ el@@ ay@@ a, re@@ appe@@ ared in the country in@@ side the Brazi@@ li@@ an emb@@ ass@@ y in T@@ eg@@ u@@ ci@@ g@@ al@@ p@@ a after three months of ex@@ i@@ le.
Although his presence dramati@@ cally fu@@ ell@@ ed the situation for a time, Brazi@@ li@@ an diplom@@ at@@ s, working with the US, were able to reach agreement with H@@ on@@ du@@ ra@@ n authorities to allow Man@@ u@@ el Z@@ el@@ ay@@ a to return to offic@@ e.
Th@@ en came the news that Brazi@@ l will ho@@ st the 201@@ 6 Sum@@ mer Olymp@@ ic G@@ am@@ es – this coming on top of ho@@ sting the 201@@ 4 World C@@ up@@ .
As for the global – and fortun@@ ately now ab@@ ating – economic crisis, Brazi@@ l has sh@@ ined through@@ out, rec@@ ording a fast and strong recover@@ y. And, as if this good news were not enough@@ , Braz@@ il@@ ’s gi@@ ant state oil comp@@ an@@ y, P@@ et@@ ro@@ br@@ á@@ s, is already at work developing two huge deep@@ -@@ water oil fiel@@ ds dis@@ cover@@ ed in the se@@ a off the co@@ ast of Ri@@ o de J@@ an@@ ei@@ ro@@ .
For these and other reason@@ s, Brazi@@ l is gain@@ ing the world’s atten@@ tion.
Brazi@@ li@@ an democracy, at long la@@ st, is working well@@ , following many years of military government, and its economy seems more ro@@ b@@ ust than ever@@ .
As a result, many people are enth@@ usi@@ as@@ tic@@ ally poin@@ ting to an increased international role for Brazi@@ l in the future.
But two connec@@ ted and major challenges li@@ e ahead for Brazi@@ l and its government@@ : the need to build a far more equal society and to res@@ ist the temp@@ tation to use nation@@ alism to mas@@ k whatever domestic fail@@ ures may mani@@ f@@ est themsel@@ ves.
Braz@@ il@@ ’s current success is roo@@ ted not only in L@@ ul@@ a’s two term@@ s, which must end in 201@@ 0.
The economic stabili@@ zation program en@@ ac@@ ted by Fern@@ and@@ o H@@ en@@ ri@@ que Car@@ do@@ so since 199@@ 4 (the Re@@ al Plan@@ ), first as finance minister and then as president for two term@@ s, soli@@ di@@ fied a structure that made it possible for L@@ ul@@ a’s ten@@ ure to be so prosper@@ ous.
This is not meant to take anything away from L@@ ul@@ a.
His presiden@@ cy has guarante@@ ed political stability and strength@@ ened social co@@ h@@ esi@@ on.
Indeed, by man@@ aging the political process to make the government work for Braz@@ il@@ ’s people, L@@ ul@@ a’s administration has made Brazi@@ l a truly stable and consen@@ su@@ al democracy.
There is nothing mo@@ dest about that achiev@@ em@@ ent, given Braz@@ il@@ ’s traditional institutional inst@@ ability and the seri@@ es of major corruption sc@@ and@@ als that eng@@ ul@@ f@@ ed L@@ ul@@ a’s government in 2005 and 200@@ 6.
L@@ ula survi@@ ved those sc@@ and@@ als and did not move to am@@ end the constitu@@ tion in order to seek a third ter@@ m, though some in Brazi@@ l pressed him to do so.
L@@ ula also en@@ ac@@ ted critic@@ ally important social policies.
Un@@ der his government, two million hom@@ es received elec@@ tri@@ c power for the first time, 11 million very poor famili@@ es gain@@ ed the support of a minim@@ um income (the B@@ ol@@ s@@ a Fam@@ í@@ li@@ a@@ ), the minim@@ um sal@@ ary gre@@ w 4@@ 5% in real term@@ s, thus benef@@ iting 4@@ 2 million people.
Moreover, ei@@ ght million jobs were cre@@ ated, 1@@ 7 million people es@@ cap@@ ed pover@@ ty, and the income of the poorest 50% gre@@ w 3@@ 2% – t@@ wi@@ ce as fast as the income of the rich@@ est 10% in the same peri@@ od.
And L@@ ula achieved all this without trig@@ gering infl@@ ation, which he knows – perhaps a result of his own im@@ pover@@ ished chil@@ d@@ hood – w@@ re@@ ak@@ s ha@@ vo@@ c on the poor most of all.
This vast transform@@ ation has not only gener@@ ated a vir@@ tu@@ ous cir@@ cle that strength@@ ened institutional stability and social capit@@ al.
It has also differ@@ enti@@ ated Brazi@@ l from other countries in Latin America, put@@ ting the country in the for@@ ef@@ ron@@ t in the region in terms of de@@ aling with traditional social and economic in@@ justi@@ ces in a democratic way.
Yet the rema@@ ining challenges are hu@@ ge, for Brazi@@ l remains the se@@ v@@ enth most un@@ equal society in the world – and severe violence persi@@ st@@ s.
Si@@ x@@ t@@ y-@@ four perc@@ ent of Brazi@@ li@@ an hom@@ es lack electric@@ ity and san@@ it@@ ation, and only 2@@ 2% have electric@@ ity, a tel@@ ep@@ h@@ one, a compu@@ ter, a re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator@@ , a tel@@ evi@@ sion, and a w@@ ash@@ ing mach@@ ine.
In the poorest region@@ , the North and Nor@@ the@@ ast@@ , the numbers fall to 8@@ .@@ 6% and 8@@ .@@ 3@@ %.
Am@@ ong the yo@@ ung, almost 3@@ 7% of 18@@ -@@ 2@@ 4@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ olds do not fin@@ ish high school@@ .
Only half the population over age 25 has more than ei@@ ght years of form@@ al educ@@ ation.
As for Braz@@ il@@ ’s international ro@@ le, a sub@@ t@@ le competition is emerging with the US.
America wants to conclu@@ de as many fre@@ e-@@ trade agreements in the region as it c@@ an, while Brazi@@ l favor@@ s exp@@ anding its cu@@ sto@@ m uni@@ on, M@@ er@@ co@@ sul@@ /@@ M@@ er@@ co@@ sur@@ .
The ent@@ ran@@ ce of Venezuel@@ a into the Brazi@@ li@@ an blo@@ c, Brazi@@ li@@ an leadership at the United Nations mission in Hai@@ ti@@ , and Braz@@ il@@ ’s role in the H@@ on@@ du@@ ra@@ n aff@@ air are all part of this emerging competi@@ tion.
If Brazi@@ l is to remain on its prosper@@ ous pa@@ th, it must continue to give higher pri@@ ority to its social and economic programs than to foreign adv@@ ent@@ ur@@ es.
The construction of a major eg@@ alit@@ ari@@ an, fre@@ e, and democratic society that respec@@ ts and works with the international institutions is the best thing that Brazi@@ l can give to the world right now.
I@@ ST@@ AN@@ B@@ U@@ L – Will the recent rap@@ pro@@ ch@@ ement between the United States and Syri@@ a mark a new era in Syri@@ a’s international stand@@ ing@@ ?
Syri@@ a can hope for two major changes following the restor@@ ation of full diplomatic relations with the US.
First, it will be remo@@ ved from America’s inform@@ al bl@@ ack@@ list of “@@ A@@ xis of E@@ vil@@ ” countries, which will substanti@@ ally improve its chan@@ ces to enter the World Trade Organ@@ iz@@ ation.
Second, Syri@@ a will probably receive the go@@ -@@ ahead for a pi@@ pel@@ ine to bring Iraqi oil across its terri@@ tory to Turke@@ y.
Such a lin@@ k to Turkey’s economy – and thus possibly to the European Union – would encourage Syri@@ a to open its economy even more to foreign invest@@ ment.
But all of this will und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly come at a pri@@ ce.
Syri@@ a’s side of the bar@@ gain will inv@@ ari@@ ably need to be an end to its support for Hez@@ bollah in Leban@@ on, for which it will likely seek the return of the Gol@@ an Hei@@ gh@@ ts.
Israel would pres@@ um@@ ably res@@ ist this out@@ come, and Iran – as leader of the so-called “@@ Shi@@ a c@@ res@@ cent@@ ” spread@@ ing from Leban@@ on to Ta@@ j@@ ik@@ ist@@ an – would stron@@ g@@ ly, and perhaps viol@@ ently, op@@ pose such a bar@@ gain as well.
During Iranian President Mah@@ m@@ oud Ahmad@@ ine@@ j@@ ad@@ ’s visit to Syri@@ a earlier this year, Syri@@ a’s President B@@ ash@@ ar As@@ sa@@ d and he rei@@ ter@@ ated their un@@ yiel@@ ding cooperation in the face of “@@ Western manipul@@ ations@@ .”
But As@@ sa@@ d is under growing pressure from the ran@@ ks of his B@@ aat@@ h Party to moderni@@ ze the country and its infrastructu@@ re, which is impossible without improved ties to the Wes@@ t.
Syri@@ a’s economy is a r@@ ust pi@@ le.
With a per capita income of $@@ 2,@@ 00@@ 0, it has been clos@@ ed to the outside world until rec@@ ent@@ ly.
R@@ ation@@ ing is per@@ v@@ asi@@ ve.
But, in order to secure public suppor@@ t, As@@ s@@ ad@@ ’s government has allowed for greater domestic consump@@ tion, so foreign impor@@ ts are rising fa@@ st.
Indeed, the country has run a trade deficit since 200@@ 5, with no path back to balance in si@@ gh@@ t.
S@@ up@@ pos@@ edly “@@ friend@@ ly@@ ” countries like Iran have been giving a helping hand, but almost always in the form of oil – and not even re@@ fin@@ ed oil –@@  @@ rather than c@@ ash@@ .
The effort to liber@@ alize foreign investment has not taken up the s@@ lack in investment from the regi@@ me@@ ’s regional political partn@@ ers.
For example, the Foreign Invest@@ ment La@@ w of 2007, which fix@@ ed a 15@@ -@@ day de@@ ad@@ line for projects to be authori@@ z@@ ed, has resul@@ ted in only $@@ 200 million in new in@@ ward invest@@ ment.
This lack of investment has left the economy, particularly the oil indust@@ ry, in a sh@@ am@@ bl@@ es.
A member of O@@ P@@ EC@@ , Syri@@ a is now a net impor@@ ter of o@@ il.
The ruling Shi@@ a eli@@ te that sur@@ round@@ s President As@@ sa@@ d – and that, together with the military oli@@ g@@ arch@@ y, re@@ tains almost total control of the economy – appears to be interest@@ ed mainly in preser@@ ving the stag@@ n@@ ant status quo@@ .
In opposition stand Syri@@ a’s Sun@@ ni tra@@ ders, who are jo@@ ined in dem@@ anding a change in the rules of the g@@ ame by the country’s various min@@ ori@@ ties, com@@ posed of two million Christi@@ ans, 1.@@ 7 million Kur@@ ds, and 4@@ 00@@ ,000 Dru@@ z@@ e.
The combined economic wei@@ ght of the Christi@@ ans – N@@ est@@ ori@@ ans, Mar@@ on@@ it@@ es, C@@ atholi@@ c Gre@@ ek@@ s, and Syri@@ ac@@ s – is greater than their ac@@ tual num@@ ber, and the B@@ ath@@ ist regime has always sought to ac@@ com@@ mod@@ ate these min@@ ori@@ ties.
But it was only with the acc@@ ession to power of B@@ ash@@ ir al As@@ sa@@ d that they were given more economic and political bre@@ a@@ thing sp@@ ac@@ e.
As@@ sa@@ d has good reason to do so, because the un@@ equal distribution of weal@@ th, combined with an official unemployment rate of 15@@ %, is fuel@@ ing social pressu@@ re.
The $@@ 3 fare for a b@@ us ri@@ de between A@@ le@@ pp@@ o and Dam@@ as@@ c@@ us might look che@@ ap to some@@ one from outside Syri@@ a, bu@@ t, given that a well-@@ tra@@ ined techni@@ ci@@ an may ear@@ n only $@@ 1@@ 50 month@@ ly, it is almost pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tively exp@@ ensi@@ ve.
A warming of relations with the US could set in play two typ@@ es of dynam@@ ic@@ s: one origin@@ ates with the OEC@@ D@@ ’s development initi@@ ative for the Middle East and North Africa (@@ M@@ E@@ NA@@ ), created in 200@@ 4.
For the first time, the OEC@@ D became directly involved with non-@@ member countries in the Middle East, and in 2009 Syri@@ a was inclu@@ ded in its development cooperation ma@@ ster pl@@ an.
The second positive dynam@@ ic may come from improved Turk@@ ish@@ -@@ Syri@@ an economic ties.
Bil@@ ater@@ al relations started to th@@ a@@ w 12 years ago, when Syri@@ a exp@@ ell@@ ed the leader of the violent Kur@@ dis@@ h separ@@ ati@@ st P@@ K@@ K movem@@ ent, Ab@@ dul@@ la@@ h O@@ cal@@ an.
A Turk@@ ish@@ -@@ Syri@@ an Bus@@ iness Council was established soon after with the hope of developing economic rel@@ ations, but little impact has been fel@@ t, owing to Turkey’s ling@@ ering susp@@ ici@@ on of Syri@@ a’s political ali@@ gn@@ ment.
The only Turkish investment was made in the tex@@ ti@@ le fiel@@ d by the fir@@ m Ak@@ tek@@ s.
Last year, however, as Prime Minister Rec@@ ep Ta@@ y@@ y@@ i@@ p Erdo@@ g@@ an push@@ ed forward on strength@@ ening Turkey’s Middle Eastern ties, vis@@ a require@@ ments between the two countries were eas@@ ed, with cros@@ s-@@ border c@@ ar tra@@ ff@@ ic increasing 2@@ 2% in five month@@ s.
Re@@ g@@ ular b@@ us lines have been open@@ ed, and, according to a high-@@ rank@@ ing Turkish bank offici@@ al, “@@ We were h@@ es@@ it@@ ating about opening a bran@@ ch in Syri@@ a because of the US em@@ bar@@ go@@ , so the sen@@ ding of an en@@ vo@@ y is like a gre@@ en light to us@@ .”
For Syri@@ a, the choice now is between sei@@ zing this opportunity to open its economy, or re@@ tre@@ ating back into its B@@ a@@ ath@@ ist sh@@ ell@@ . The benefits of such an opening are cle@@ ar.
The question is whether Syri@@ a’s rul@@ ers can make the political choic@@ es necessary to ob@@ tain them.
Un@@ less inflation dro@@ ps much mor@@ e, now is an ide@@ al time to be a bor@@ ro@@ wer and a bad time to be a l@@ ender or invest@@ or in long-term bond@@ s.
Indeed, in many countries, ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated fear@@ s of defl@@ ation are ke@@ eping interest rates de@@ pressed and the cost of capital at histor@@ ic low@@ s.
The low@@ est rates were seen on Jun@@ e 1@@ 3 th .
T@@ en-@@ year bonds in the US yiel@@ ded 3.@@ 1@@ 1@@ %, not much above the 2.@@ 1% inflation rate of the past 12 month@@ s.
T@@ en-@@ year government bonds in the Euro@@ -@@ area yiel@@ ded 3.@@ 5@@ 4@@ %, while the Euro@@ -@@ area inflation rate was 1.@@ 9@@ %.
The yiel@@ d in the U@@ K was 3.@@ 8@@ 6@@ %, while inflation was 3@@ %, and Japanese bonds yiel@@ ded 0.@@ 4@@ 4@@ %, compared with inflation of -@@ 0.@@ 1@@ %.
In each case, a small increase in toda@@ y's very low inflation rates would elimin@@ ate any real gain from invest@@ ing in bond@@ s.
If low long-term rates do not hol@@ d, long-term bond prices will dro@@ p shar@@ pl@@ y, leaving investors with a los@@ s.
The history of develop@@ ed-@@ country bond markets in the last hal@@ f-@@ century is relatively stra@@ igh@@ t@@ for@@ war@@ d.
Con@@ su@@ mer inflation increased fair@@ ly ste@@ adi@@ ly (@@ al@@ beit with major short-@@ run s@@ w@@ ing@@ s@@ ), until the oil crises of 197@@ 3@@ -@@ 4 and 197@@ 9@@ -@@ 8@@ 1 pro@@ p@@ ell@@ ed it to histor@@ ic high@@ s in Europe, North America, Japan and other countries.
Af@@ ter@@ war@@ ds, the tren@@ d was re@@ vers@@ ed, and inflation decl@@ ined fair@@ ly ste@@ adi@@ ly.
The oil crises mark@@ ed a political as well as an economic tur@@ ning poin@@ t.
Un@@ til that time, central banks, fear@@ ing recession@@ , were gradu@@ ally los@@ ing their gri@@ p on infl@@ ation.
But public anger over sk@@ y-@@ high price growth pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ated by the oil crises finally allowed central banks to ti@@ gh@@ ten credit and smo@@ ther inflation with massive global recession@@ s.
Cor@@ por@@ ate manag@@ ers, mean@@ while, go@@ t the public support needed to res@@ ist many cost@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ living allow@@ ances that were fuel@@ ing a wa@@ ge-@@ price sp@@ ir@@ al.
The general invest@@ ing public never really under@@ stood these tren@@ ds.
They did not compreh@@ end the up@@ ward tren@@ d in prices before 198@@ 0, so bond yiel@@ ds, lag@@ ging behind rising infl@@ ation, were too low@@ .
In the US, ten@@ -@@ year US Treasury yiel@@ ds aver@@ aged only 1.@@ 4@@ 6% above the inflation rate between 195@@ 3, when annual average inflation was only 0.@@ 6@@ 3@@ %, and Mar@@ ch 198@@ 0, when inflation pe@@ ak@@ ed at 1@@ 4@@ .@@ 6@@ 6@@ %.
Nor did the invest@@ ing public fully compreh@@ end the down@@ tren@@ d in inflation after 198@@ 0, so long-term bond yiel@@ ds, lag@@ ging behind falling infl@@ ation, were too high@@ .
In the US, yiel@@ ds on ten@@ -@@ year Treas@@ uri@@ es have aver@@ aged 4@@ .@@ 1@@ 4% above the rate of inflation throughout the period of decl@@ ining inflation that began in April 198@@ 0.
The public@@ 's failure to recognize inflation tren@@ ds meant that long-term bonds were a terri@@ ble investment until 198@@ 0, when inflation was only a little lower than yiel@@ ds, and a lu@@ c@@ rative investment there@@ af@@ ter, when decl@@ ining inflation and high yiel@@ ds guarante@@ ed large real gain@@ s.
Invest@@ ors are again making the mist@@ ake of pric@@ ing bonds in expec@@ tation that the down@@ ward tren@@ d of inflation will continue into defl@@ ation@@ ary terri@@ tor@@ y.
Indeed, toda@@ y's low long-term rates suggest that investors are projec@@ ting the down@@ ward tren@@ d to continue over the next ten years at the same p@@ ace that it has done since 198@@ 0, im@@ pl@@ ying that the current US inflation rate of 2.@@ 1% would fall to zer@@ o or below by 201@@ 3.
Is this reason@@ able@@ ?
Al@@ most certainly not.
No central bank would per@@ mit defl@@ ation for lon@@ g, and the current level of inflation probably repres@@ ents the lower bo@@ und@@ ary that most monetary authorities consider accep@@ t@@ able.
At the same time, there is no such clear u@@ pp@@ er bound to infl@@ ation.
So with inflation rates near their long-term lower bo@@ und, the expec@@ tation should be for higher , not lower@@ , inflation rates over the longer ter@@ m.
The current situation in the bond markets does not reflect this because of public over@@ re@@ action to the talk of defl@@ ation, with Japan used as a scar@@ ec@@ row@@ .
But even in Japan, annual defl@@ ation has been only about 0.@@ 7% since 199@@ 8, and was caused by a mon@@ et@@ ar@@ y-@@ policy er@@ ror unlikely to be repe@@ ated.
Japan is really the only example of adv@@ anc@@ ed-@@ country defl@@ ation in the post-@@ 194@@ 5 er@@ a.
So why should bad policy by the Bank of Japan set the tren@@ d for world inflation rat@@ es?
Indeed, the opposi@@ te may be the cas@@ e: comb@@ ating defl@@ ation could have the per@@ verse effect of creating high infl@@ ation.
This is what Mas@@ ur@@ u Ha@@ y@@ am@@ i, the former govern@@ or of the Bank of Japan, fear@@ ed when he resist@@ ed calls for more monetary stimul@@ us.
He was right to wor@@ r@@ y: a sharp@@ ly exp@@ anding money supply may have un@@ expected and un@@ quanti@@ fi@@ able lag@@ ged effec@@ ts.
The kin@@ ds of he@@ ter@@ o@@ do@@ x monetary policy that might be used to prevent defl@@ ation simil@@ arly risk an over@@ re@@ action and renew@@ ed infl@@ ation.
But fear of defl@@ ation is so widespread nowad@@ a@@ ys that if inflation over@@ sho@@ o@@ ts the targe@@ t, central banks will merely try to stop further infl@@ ation, rather than try to bring the consumer price level back down which would mean defl@@ ation.
Th@@ en any inflation@@ ary monetary policy er@@ ror@@ s driven by ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated fear@@ s of defl@@ ation will be allowed to stand, and the cum@@ ul@@ ative inflation will off@@ set any retur@@ ns on investments in long-term bond@@ s.
Toda@@ y's fear@@ s about defl@@ ation may repres@@ ent a histor@@ ic tur@@ ning poin@@ t, much as when the public mo@@ od turned deci@@ si@@ vely against inflation around 198@@ 0.
Con@@ ven@@ tional wis@@ dom has chan@@ ge@@ d, and many people will be bre@@ a@@ thing a si@@ gh of re@@ lief when inflation rates rise above 3% or more in the US and elsewher@@ e.
If we have ar@@ ri@@ ved at such a tur@@ ning poin@@ t, as the tren@@ d in bond markets in recent week@@ s might sug@@ ges@@ t, it will be a tur@@ ning point for interest rates and bond prices as well.
The current combin@@ ation of excep@@ tion@@ ally low yiel@@ ds and high prices suggests that much of the world is in a bond@@ -@@ market bub@@ ble, and when it bur@@ sts in coming years, a period of higher long-term interest rates and lower long-term bond prices will follow@@ .
E@@ M@@ B@@ AR@@ G@@ O 6 S@@ E@@ P@@ T@@ E@@ M@@ B@@ E@@ R 2004
More than for@@ ty years ago, Turkey app@@ lied for associ@@ ate membership of the European Economic Commun@@ ity.
With the As@@ soci@@ ation agreement of 196@@ 3, a special relationship was establish@@ ed, cul@@ min@@ ating in the custom@@ s union of 199@@ 6.
During all these years, European governments consist@@ ently con@@ firm@@ ed Turke@@ y's eli@@ gi@@ bility for full member@@ ship, making acc@@ ession dependent on compli@@ ance with membership cri@@ teri@@ a.
Turke@@ y's form@@ al recogni@@ tion as a candidate state in 1999 led Turkey to under@@ take unpreced@@ ented reform efforts in the area of human and min@@ ority rights, including ab@@ oli@@ tion of the death pen@@ al@@ ty, saf@@ eg@@ u@@ ards against tor@@ tu@@ re, promo@@ tion of religious freedom@@ s, gender equ@@ ality, and restric@@ tion of the milit@@ ar@@ y's role in political life.
Sh@@ ould the EU consider the acc@@ ession cri@@ ter@@ ia as having been ful@@ fil@@ le@@ d, it must decide to open negotiations in early 200@@ 5.
Not to do so would mean to ren@@ ege on political commit@@ ments and to sever@@ ely damage the EU@@ 's credi@@ bility in the world.
In many parts of Europe, however, Turke@@ y's ad@@ mission to the EU is viewed with skep@@ tic@@ ism owing to its si@@ z@@ e, relatively poor economy, fear@@ s of massive immig@@ ration, and, above all, cultural and societ@@ al differences - a eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism for Islam@@ .
It would be fo@@ oli@@ sh to den@@ y that some of these factors repres@@ ent serious challen@@ ges.
However, they are often ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated and certainly not insur@@ moun@@ t@@ able.
Ne@@ goti@@ ations with Turkey would be l@@ eng@@ thy and acc@@ ession may not occ@@ ur before 201@@ 5.
This period of time would offer both Turkey and the Union an opportunity to come to term@@ s.
With 8@@ 0 million people, Turkey would be one of the largest EU states.
But the size of a country pla@@ ys only a limited role in the EU@@ 's decision@@ -@@ making proc@@ ess, because political influence within the Union depends more on economic power.
Moreover, for decades Turkey has been a responsible member of many European institutions, and there is no reason to believe that it would act differ@@ ently in the EU.
Because of its weak economy, Turkey would be eli@@ gi@@ ble for substantial EU assi@@ st@@ ance.
The size of these trans@@ fer@@ s, however, would depend on the EU@@ 's financial policies at the time of ad@@ mission@@ , the outcome of acc@@ ession negoti@@ ations, and economic develop@@ ments in Turke@@ y.
In any case, the EU@@ 's practi@@ ce of "@@ c@@ app@@ ing@@ " its budget would prevent an explo@@ sion in the financial costs ent@@ ail@@ ed by Turke@@ y's acc@@ ession@@ .
I@@ mm@@ ig@@ ration should not be a cause for un@@ due conc@@ ern, ei@@ ther.
Hum@@ an mo@@ bility is limit@@ ed, and Turkey work@@ er@@ s@@ ' would probably be allowed to move fre@@ ely within the EU only after a long transition peri@@ od, possibly not before 20@@ 2@@ 5.
Given the expected up@@ s@@ wing of Turke@@ y's economy and its decl@@ ining bir@@ th@@ rat@@ e, exper@@ ts predic@@ t a fig@@ ure of around 2.@@ 7 million immig@@ rants by that poin@@ t.
Meanwhile, dimin@@ ish@@ ing and aging popul@@ ations in most of Europe will have made immig@@ ration a nec@@ essi@@ ty.
Am@@ ong the countries from where immig@@ ration to the EU is prob@@ able, Turkey has the best prospec@@ ts for successful adap@@ t@@ ation.
It is Turke@@ y's Muslim population that cre@@ ates the stron@@ gest emo@@ tions.
Many feel that Turkey simply does not f@@ it into a European society based on Christi@@ an tradi@@ tions and cultu@@ re.
It is also fear@@ ed that Islam@@ ists may one day turn Turkey into a fundament@@ alist state.
Un@@ likely as it may be in view of Turke@@ y's deeply roo@@ ted sec@@ ular@@ ism, such a risk cannot be tot@@ ally exclu@@ ded.
But the same is true for any other democracy, where radical groups could well mis@@ use the democratic process for their pur@@ pos@@ es.
Su@@ rel@@ y, the best protection against such a cal@@ am@@ ity is to strengthen Turke@@ y's democratic system, which can best be achieved by an@@ ch@@ or@@ ing it firm@@ ly in a blo@@ c of simil@@ arly democratic countries.
As for the EU, it must decide whether it wants to be a clos@@ ed "@@ Christi@@ an cl@@ ub@@ " or an open and inclu@@ sive societ@@ y, draw@@ ing streng@@ th from cultural and religious diversi@@ ty.
Turke@@ y's acc@@ ession to the Union would give a powerful answer@@ , one that would be hear@@ d with particular cl@@ arity in the Islamic world.
The need to refu@@ te argum@@ ents against Turke@@ y's ad@@ mission to the EU lea@@ ves the adv@@ ant@@ ages r@@ ar@@ ely men@@ tion@@ ed@@ : its uni@@ que geo@@ political position at the cros@@ s@@ road@@ s of the Bal@@ kan@@ s, Sou@@ thern C@@ au@@ cas@@ us, Central Asia, and the Middle East - vit@@ ally important regions for Europe's securit@@ y; its role as ma@@ y@@ or transi@@ t country for energy supp@@ li@@ es; its military cap@@ abilities at a time when the EU is developing its new European Def@@ ense Poli@@ cy@@ ; and the great potential of the Turkish economy, with its young and dynam@@ ic labor forc@@ e.
At the same time, the risks of rejec@@ ting Turkey must also be taken into accoun@@ t: the lik@@ eli@@ hood that the reform process would collap@@ se, bringing radical curr@@ ents to the fore and leading to inst@@ ability and political un@@ rest at the EU@@ 's do@@ or@@ step@@ s.
Turkish EU membership pres@@ ents both opportunities and challen@@ ges.
On bal@@ ance, however, the adv@@ ant@@ ages far out@@ wei@@ gh the risk@@ s.
Mu@@ ch of America’s domin@@ ance in world finance comes from the dollar@@ ’s status as international mone@@ y.
America’s commitment to free capital markets, the rule of law, and price stability conf@@ er credi@@ bility on the dollar as a stor@@ e of valu@@ e.
But American spending hab@@ its have undermin@@ ed the dollar@@ ’s re@@ put@@ ation, with the exc@@ ess supply of dollars on world markets de@@ press@@ ing its pri@@ ce.
This spr@@ ing, the euro@@ ’s exchange rate against the dollar reached an all-@@ time high@@ , and central banks have increased the euro share of their international reser@@ ves.
Is the dollar about to lose the c@@ rown of world finance to the euro@@ ?
Hist@@ ory suggests other@@ wise, despite a vulnerable doll@@ ar.
American financial su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy in the twent@@ y-@@ first century res@@ em@@ bl@@ es Britain@@ ’s position in world finance a century ago.
Be@@ fore the out@@ break of World War I in August 19@@ 1@@ 4, the po@@ und ster@@ ling ser@@ ved as the currency of choice for international trans@@ ac@@ tions, just as the dollar does today, and the world’s bor@@ ro@@ wer@@ s visi@@ ted the C@@ ity of London to raise capit@@ al.
The British econom@@ ist John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Keynes wor@@ ried that countries would not use ster@@ ling to sett@@ le trading balances with each other if the po@@ und were not viewed as a reli@@ able stor@@ e of valu@@ e.
The “@@ future position of the C@@ ity of L@@ on@@ don@@ ,” according to Keyn@@ es, depen@@ ded on the po@@ und ster@@ ling continuing to serve the business world as the equi@@ valent of g@@ ol@@ d.
Britain maintain@@ ed the po@@ und@@ ’s conver@@ ti@@ bility into gold at the out@@ break of the Great War to preser@@ ve its credi@@ bility as the international medi@@ um of ex@@ change.
The dollar could not challenge ster@@ ling@@ ’s role as the world’s currency without mat@@ ching its re@@ put@@ ation.
August 19@@ 1@@ 4 provided the opport@@ un@@ ity.
The biggest gold out@@ f@@ low in a generation im@@ per@@ il@@ ed America’s ability to re@@ pay its deb@@ ts ab@@ road@@ .
F@@ e@@ ar that the US would aband@@ on the gold standard sent the dollar pl@@ um@@ m@@ eting on world markets.
But Treasury Secretary W@@ illi@@ am G@@ . Mc@@ A@@ do@@ o secu@@ red American financial hon@@ or in August 19@@ 1@@ 4 by rema@@ ining true to gold while everyone el@@ se, exc@@ ept for the Briti@@ sh@@ , aband@@ oned their oblig@@ ations.
Despite the dollar@@ ’s inst@@ ant credi@@ bilit@@ y, however, it took more than a decade for America’s currency to mat@@ ch Britain@@ ’s as an international medi@@ um of ex@@ change.
P@@ ay@@ ment hab@@ its mel@@ t at a gl@@ ac@@ ier@@ ’s p@@ ac@@ e.
Britain@@ ’s transform@@ ation from international credi@@ tor to international deb@@ tor during the Great War gave the dollar a second win@@ d in its batt@@ le with ster@@ l@@ ing.
The British were forced to aband@@ on gold conver@@ ti@@ bility in April 19@@ 1@@ 9 – a tac@@ tical withdraw@@ al inten@@ ded to pa@@ ve the way for Britain@@ ’s return to the former $@@ 4@@ .@@ 8@@ 6@@ 6@@ 5 par@@ ity with the American doll@@ ar.
Si@@ x years later, in April 19@@ 2@@ 5, Britain con@@ firm@@ ed its monetary credi@@ bility and re@@ turned to the gold stand@@ ar@@ d.
But the po@@ und had already suff@@ ered ir@@ re@@ par@@ able dam@@ age.
The experience of 19@@ 1@@ 4 implies that a credi@@ ble alternative can re@@ place an ent@@ ren@@ ched world curren@@ cy, especially after an un@@ favor@@ able balance of trade has weak@@ ened it.
But even then, de@@ th@@ ron@@ ing the reig@@ ning king of international exchange takes time.
Today, the euro – a currency without a country – lack@@ s a long tra@@ ck record of credi@@ bilit@@ y.
Thir@@ te@@ en countries in the European Union use the euro as mone@@ y.
But the commitment of these independent political enti@@ ties to the euro cannot mat@@ ch the history of America’s commitment to the doll@@ ar.
The European Central Bank, established in 199@@ 8, has a mand@@ ate to manage the new currency to maintain price stabilit@@ y.
But the ECB needs time to establish its inflation@@ -@@ fighting cre@@ denti@@ als.
It cannot h@@ it@@ ch a ri@@ de on g@@ ol@@ d, the way America did a century ago.
So the euro must ear@@ n its re@@ put@@ ation crisis by crisis to confron@@ t the dollar@@ ’s domin@@ ance as the currency of choice for international trans@@ ac@@ tions.
Rec@@ ent experience with the euro as an official reser@@ ve asset is in@@ struc@@ tive.
Bet@@ ween 2000 and 200@@ 5, the dollar lost more than 2@@ 5% of its value against the euro@@ .
Meanwhile, the fra@@ c@@ tion of international reserves held in euro@@ s gre@@ w from 18@@ % to 2@@ 4@@ %, and the dollar@@ ’s share dro@@ pped from 7@@ 1% to 6@@ 6@@ %.
In shor@@ t, the euro has clearly made some head@@ way during this period of US balance of pay@@ ment defic@@ its, but this reflects an ev@@ olu@@ tionary decline in the dollar@@ ’s domin@@ ance, not a revolution@@ ary regime shi@@ ft.
What might trig@@ ger a f@@ at@@ al run on the dollar in world market@@ s?
While a broad and ab@@ rup@@ t s@@ ell@@ -@@ off by major foreign hol@@ ders of dollars – for example, China – appears un@@ lik@@ el@@ y, a cat@@ ac@@ ly@@ sm@@ ic ev@@ ent, similar to the out@@ break of the Great War in 19@@ 1@@ 4, could pro@@ mp@@ t a se@@ ar@@ ch for a new international medi@@ um of ex@@ change.
In the modern era of autom@@ ated pay@@ ments, the up@@ heav@@ al might come from a terrorist attack that undermin@@ es the compu@@ ter@@ ized trans@@ fer fac@@ ili@@ ties of the world’s banking system.
A c@@ atastroph@@ ic loss of elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic rec@@ or@@ ds could su@@ rely destro@@ y the credi@@ bility of the dollar as the international medi@@ um of ex@@ change.
But exac@@ tly what would re@@ place the dollar under such circum@@ stan@@ ces remains an open ques@@ tion.
After all, a loss of compu@@ ter rec@@ or@@ ds would make the euro equally susp@@ ec@@ t.
Perhaps g@@ ol@@ d, a stor@@ e of value im@@ per@@ vious to physi@@ cal di@@ stor@@ tion, could make a com@@ eb@@ ack@@ .
Of course, one can only hope that such a scenari@@ o remains p@@ ure con@@ jec@@ tu@@ re.
CAMBRIDGE – The European Economic and Monetary Union (@@ E@@ M@@ U@@ ) and the euro are about to cel@@ eb@@ rate their t@@ enth anni@@ vers@@ ary.
The euro was introduc@@ ed without serious problems and has since func@@ tioned well@@ , with the European Central Bank deliver@@ ing the low inflation that is its sol@@ e mand@@ ate.
But the current economic crisis may provide a severe test of the euro@@ ’s ability to survi@@ ve in more troub@@ led tim@@ es.
While the crisis could strengthen the institutions provided by the E@@ M@@ U@@ , it could also create multi@@ ple risk@@ s, of which member countries need to be aw@@ are if they want to avoid them.
The primary problem is that conditions in individual E@@ M@@ U members may develop in such different ways that some national political leaders could be temp@@ ted to conclu@@ de that their countries would be better ser@@ ved by adop@@ ting a mi@@ x of policies different from that of the other member@@ s.
The current differences in the interest rates of euro@@ -@@ zone government bonds show that the financial markets regard a break@@ -@@ up as a real possi@@ bilit@@ y.
T@@ en-@@ year government bonds in Greece and I@@ rel@@ and, for example, now pay nearly a full percentage point above the rate on compar@@ able German bond@@ s, and Ital@@ y’s rate is almost as high@@ .
There ha@@ ve, of course, been many exam@@ ples in history in which currency uni@@ ons or sing@@ le-@@ currency states have bro@@ ken up@@ .
Although there are techni@@ cal and legal reasons why such a sp@@ li@@ t would be har@@ der for an E@@ M@@ U country, there seems little doubt that a country could with@@ draw if it really wanted to@@ .
The most obvious reason that a country might choose to with@@ draw is to es@@ cap@@ e from the one-@@ si@@ z@@ e-@@ f@@ it@@ s-@@ all monetary policy imposed by the single curren@@ cy.
A country that fin@@ ds its economy very de@@ pressed during the next few years, and fear@@ s that this will be chron@@ ic@@ , might be temp@@ ted to leave the E@@ M@@ U in order to e@@ ase monetary conditions and de@@ value its curren@@ cy.
Although that may or may not be economic@@ ally sensi@@ ble, a country in a severe economic down@@ turn might very well take such a policy deci@@ sion.
The Stability and Gro@@ w@@ th P@@ ac@@ t, which limits euro@@ -@@ zone member@@ s’ fiscal defic@@ its, is another reason why a country might want to leave the E@@ M@@ U@@ . In a serious down@@ tur@@ n, a country may wish to pursue a traditional Keyn@@ esi@@ an policy through lar@@ ge-@@ sc@@ al@@ e, defic@@ it@@ -@@ financ@@ ed fiscal stimul@@ us.
Although the Stability and Gro@@ w@@ th P@@ act may be el@@ as@@ tic enough to per@@ mit some deficit stimul@@ us, a country may feel constra@@ ined from ac@@ ting as aggressi@@ vely as it w@@ ant@@ s.
The current financial crisis rais@@ es yet another problem@@ : the lack of a clear “@@ l@@ ender of last res@@ or@@ t@@ .”
It remains to be seen how willing the ECB will be to provide national central banks with the volum@@ e of euro@@ s needed to play this role ful@@ ly.
If a country se@@ es its banks fail@@ ing because its national bank cannot l@@ end them enough@@ , it may ch@@ ose to leave the E@@ M@@ U so that its central bank can provide whatever amount of local currency it de@@ em@@ s necess@@ ary.
Moreover, the current economic crisis has led to renew@@ ed talk about the need for the European Union to have tax@@ ing author@@ ity.
W@@ hat@@ ever the logi@@ c of that pro@@ posi@@ tion, it would open the do@@ or to much greater income re@@ distribu@@ tion.
H@@ igh@@ -@@ income countries might find that reason enough to want out.
Even if officials do not want to aband@@ on the euro@@ , they may come to do so as a result of a strategy of trying to get other countries to agree to a policy change.
A country that believ@@ es that monetary or fiscal policy is too ti@@ ght may thre@@ aten to leave if policy is not chan@@ ge@@ d.
That is clearly a substantial risk if the country is Germany or Fran@@ ce.
But even if it is one of the smaller countries, it might be a serious threat because it could be seen as the beginning of the end.
So either type of country could make the threat in the hope that it would be enough to cause their E@@ M@@ U colle@@ agu@@ es to agree to their desi@@ red change in policy.
The ris@@ k, of course, is that the other countries may not be in@@ tim@@ id@@ ated.
The threat@@ ening country would then have to choose whether to accep@@ ting a hum@@ ili@@ ating defe@@ at and sta@@ y, or stand on “@@ princip@@ le@@ ” and lea@@ ve.
All of this assum@@ es that political leaders would sel@@ ect only a policy change that they think will be in their nation@@ ’s long-term interes@@ t.
But there is also a risk that some politicians act sol@@ ely out of self-@@ interes@@ t, sei@@ zing on the economic down@@ turn as an opportunity to get elected by promis@@ ing to with@@ draw the country from the E@@ M@@ U@@ , or by sa@@ ying that they will thre@@ aten to do so if the other member countries do not agree to their proposed policy chan@@ ges.
N@@ one of these risks implies that the monetary union will inevit@@ ably be a vic@@ ti@@ m of this severe economic down@@ tur@@ n.
But the down@@ turn will be a more severe test for the euro than any that it faced during its first ten years.
CAMBRIDGE – As the eurozone crisis continues to deep@@ en, the International Monetary Fund may finally be acknow@@ led@@ ging the need to re@@ ass@@ ess its approach@@ .
New Man@@ aging Di@@ rec@@ tor Chri@@ st@@ ine L@@ ag@@ ar@@ de@@ ’s recent call for forced rec@@ apit@@ alization of Europe’s bankrup@@ t banking system is a good star@@ t.
European offici@@ al@@ s’ inc@@ ens@@ ed re@@ action – the banks are fin@@ e, they insi@@ st, and need only liquidity support – should serve to but@@ t@@ ress the Fund@@ ’s determin@@ ation to be sensi@@ ble about Europe.
Un@@ til now, the Fund has sy@@ co@@ ph@@ an@@ tic@@ ally supported each new European initi@@ ative to res@@ c@@ ue the over-@@ in@@ deb@@ ted eurozone peripher@@ y, commit@@ ting more than $@@ 100 billion to Greec@@ e, Portug@@ al, and I@@ re@@ land so f@@ ar.
Unfortunately, the IMF is ris@@ king not only its member@@ s’ mone@@ y, bu@@ t, ultim@@ ately, its own institutional credi@@ bilit@@ y.
Only a year ago, at the IMF@@ ’s annual meeting in Washingt@@ on, D@@ C@@ , senior st@@ af@@ f were t@@ elling anyone who would li@@ sten that the whole European sovereign@@ -@@ debt pan@@ ic was a temp@@ est in a te@@ a@@ po@@ t.
U@@ sing s@@ li@@ ck Po@@ wer@@ Po@@ int pres@@ ent@@ ations with ti@@ t@@ les like “@@ Def@@ aul@@ t in Toda@@ y’s Ad@@ v@@ anced Econom@@ i@@ es: Un@@ necess@@ ary, Un@@ desi@@ ra@@ ble, and Un@@ lik@@ el@@ y@@ ,” the Fund tried to con@@ vin@@ ce investors that eurozone debt was soli@@ d as a ro@@ ck@@ .
Even for Greec@@ e, the IMF argu@@ ed, debt dynam@@ ics were not a serious conc@@ ern, th@@ anks to anti@@ cip@@ ated growth and reform@@ s.
N@@ ever min@@ d the obvious f@@ law in the Fund@@ ’s logi@@ c, nam@@ ely that countries such as Greece and Portug@@ al face policy and implement@@ ation risks far more ak@@ in to emerging markets than to truly advanced economies such as Germany and the United Stat@@ es.
As the situation deter@@ i@@ or@@ ated, one might have gu@@ essed that the IMF would mark its beli@@ efs to market, as it wer@@ e, and adop@@ t a more cau@@ tious t@@ one.
Instead, at the IMF@@ ’s April 2011 inter@@ im me@@ et@@ ing, a senior official declared that the Fund now consi@@ ders troub@@ led Spain to be a core eurozone country like Germany, rather than a peripher@@ al country like Greec@@ e, Portug@@ al, or I@@ rel@@ and.
E@@ vi@@ d@@ ently, investors were supposed to in@@ fer that for all prac@@ tical pur@@ poses they should think of Sp@@ an@@ ish and German debt as identi@@ cal – the old h@@ ub@@ ri@@ s of the euroz@@ one.
M@@ y own s@@ ar@@ cas@@ tic re@@ action was to thin@@ k, “@@ Oh@@ , now the IMF thin@@ ks that some of the core eurozone countries are a default risk@@ .”
Ha@@ ving ser@@ ved as the IMF@@ ’s ch@@ ief econom@@ ist from 2001 to 200@@ 3, I am famili@@ ar with the Fund@@ ’s need to wal@@ k a ti@@ gh@@ tro@@ pe between building invest@@ or confidence and sh@@ aking up com@@ plac@@ ent policy@@ mak@@ ers.
But it is one thing to be circum@@ sp@@ ect in the mid@@ st of a crisi@@ s; it is quite another to spe@@ w non@@ sen@@ se.
The late Ch@@ ic@@ ag@@ o-@@ school econom@@ ist George S@@ tig@@ ler would have descri@@ bed the IMF@@ ’s role in Europe as reflec@@ ting ac@@ ute “@@ regulatory cap@@ tu@@ re@@ .”
S@@ imp@@ ly pu@@ t, Europe and the US control too much power in the IMF@@ , and their thinking is too domin@@ ant.
What European leaders may want most from the Fund are easy loans and strong rhet@@ ori@@ cal suppor@@ t.
But what Europe really needs is the kind of hon@@ est ass@@ ess@@ ment and t@@ ough lo@@ ve that the Fund has tradition@@ ally offered to its o@@ ther, less politically influ@@ enti@@ al, cli@@ ents.
The IMF@@ ’s blin@@ d spo@@ t in de@@ aling with Europe until now is only partly due to European vo@@ ting power.
It also st@@ em@@ s from an “@@ us@@ ” and “@@ them@@ ” ment@@ ality that simil@@ arly per@@ me@@ ates research at the top Wall Street investment hous@@ es.
Analy@@ sts who have worked their entire lives only on advanced economies have learned to be@@ t on things going well@@ , because for the cou@@ ple of decades pri@@ or to the crisis, things mostly did go well – very well.
That is wh@@ y, for example, so many keep assum@@ ing that a normal rapid recovery is just around the cor@@ n@@ er.
But the financial crisis should have remin@@ ded everyone that the distinc@@ tion between advanced economies and emerging markets is not a bri@@ ght red lin@@ e.
In his recent spe@@ e@@ ch in J@@ ack@@ son H@@ ol@@ e, W@@ y@@ om@@ ing, US Federal Reserve Cha@@ ir@@ man B@@ en Bernank@@ e forc@@ eful@@ ly comp@@ la@@ ined that political par@@ alysi@@ s has possibly become the princip@@ al im@@ pe@@ di@@ ment to recover@@ y.
But analy@@ sts acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to working on emerging markets understand that such par@@ alysi@@ s is very difficult to avoid after a financial crisis.
Ra@@ ther than sla@@ v@@ ish@@ ly believ@@ ing policy@@ mak@@ er@@ s’ ass@@ ur@@ ances, emerg@@ ing-@@ market resear@@ ch@@ ers have learned to be cy@@ ni@@ cal about official promis@@ es.
All too of@@ ten, everything that can be done wrong will be done wron@@ g.
The IMF needs to bring much more of this br@@ and of skep@@ tic@@ ism to its ass@@ ess@@ ment of eurozone debt dynam@@ ic@@ s, instead of con@@ st@@ antly seeking stra@@ ined assu@@ mp@@ tions that would make the debt appear sustain@@ able.
An@@ y@@ one looking clo@@ sely at Europe’s complex op@@ tions for ex@@ tric@@ ating itself from its debt stra@@ igh@@ t@@ j@@ ack@@ et should re@@ alize that political constra@@ in@@ ts will be a huge ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le no matter which rou@@ te Europe tak@@ es.
Even outside Europe, the IMF has long given too much cre@@ dence to si@@ t@@ ting government@@ s, rather than foc@@ using on the long-term interests of the country and its people.
The Fund is doing Europe’s people no favor by fail@@ ing to push aggressi@@ vely for a more realisti@@ c solu@@ tion, including dramatic debt wri@@ te@@ -@@ dow@@ ns for peripher@@ al eurozone countries and re-@@ alloc@@ ating c@@ ore@@ -@@ country guarante@@ es elsewher@@ e.
Now that the Fund has s@@ quar@@ ely acknow@@ led@@ ged the huge capital hol@@ es in many European banks, it should start press@@ ing forc@@ eful@@ ly for a comprehensive and credi@@ ble solution to the eurozone debt crisis, a solution that will invol@@ ve either par@@ tial break@@ up of the eurozone or fundamental constitutional reform@@ .
Europe’s futu@@ re, not to men@@ tion the future of the IMF@@ , depends on it.
The UN and NATO are widely perceived as dam@@ age@@ d, if not bro@@ k@@ en, by their failure to agree on what to do about Iraq.
Will these cra@@ cks in the international political system now wo@@ und the world's economic arch@@ it@@ ec@@ tu@@ re, and with it globaliz@@ ation, as well@@ ?
International economic agreements have never been easy to mak@@ e.
Re@@ ach@@ ing consensus among the World Trade Organ@@ iz@@ ation@@ 's 1@@ 4@@ 5 member@@ s, where one dis@@ sent can cause ut@@ ter dis@@ ar@@ ra@@ y, was difficult even before the world's governments divi@@ ded into pro@@ - and anti-@@ American camp@@ s.
Indeed, multilateral trade agreements were being ec@@ li@@ p@@ sed by bilateral de@@ als, such as between the EU and various developing countries, long before the divi@@ sions over Iraq appear@@ ed.
Of course, the problem goes deep@@ er and not everything that tou@@ ches globalization has turned d@@ ark@@ .
I@@ mm@@ ig@@ ration contro@@ l@@ s, for example, have been re@@ la@@ x@@ ed in several European countries (@@ not@@ ably German@@ y@@ ) due to decl@@ ining popul@@ ations and educ@@ ational short@@ com@@ ings.
But bad economic times are r@@ ar@@ ely mom@@ ents when governments push b@@ old international economic propos@@ als.
Economic fragi@@ lity among the world's leading economies is the biggest st@@ um@@ bl@@ ing block@@ .
The US and the EU have few fiscal and monetary le@@ vers left to comb@@ at weak performan@@ ce.
Sh@@ or@@ t-@@ term interest rates in the US, at 1.@@ 25@@ %, are at a 4@@ 0-@@ year low@@ .
Congress has par@@ ed $@@ 100 billion from the Bush administ@@ ration@@ 's 10@@ -@@ year $@@ 7@@ 2@@ 6 billion tax cut pl@@ an, and the US@@ 's projec@@ ted 10@@ -@@ year $@@ 2 trillion budget deficit will grow as the Iraq war@@ 's costs moun@@ t, with President Bush sub@@ mit@@ ting a supp@@ lement@@ al requ@@ est for $@@ 8@@ 0@@ b@@ n (@@ 0.@@ 8% of GDP@@ ) in ex@@ tr@@ a military spending this year.
Such spending risks ab@@ sor@@ b productive resources that could be employ@@ ed more effici@@ ently elsewher@@ e.
This was demonstrat@@ ed by the rapid growth of output and in@@ comes that followed the ar@@ ri@@ val of the so-called "@@ peace divi@@ den@@ d@@ " which came with the Cold War@@ 's end.
Moreover, others (@@ Arab countries, Germany, and Japan@@ ) will not cover America's military cost@@ s, as in the 1991 Gul@@ f War@@ .
We are now back to the more us@@ ual situation where war is financ@@ ed by government debt, which bur@@ den@@ s future gener@@ ations unless it is ero@@ ded by infl@@ ation.
In the Eurozone the sco@@ pe for fiscal stimulus (@@ lower taxes and@@ /@@ or higher public spend@@ ing@@ ) was constra@@ ined until war ble@@ w a hol@@ e in the Stability P@@ ac@@ t, which cap@@ s member budget deficits at 3% of GDP. The limit will now be re@@ la@@ x@@ ed due to the "@@ excep@@ tion@@ al@@ " circum@@ stan@@ ces imp@@ lied by the Iraq war@@ -@@ providing reli@@ ef@@ , ir@@ on@@ ically, to the war@@ 's main European oppon@@ ents, France and German@@ y.
But the European Central Bank remains rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ant to e@@ ase monetary policy.
In Japan, there seems little hope that the world's sec@@ ond@@ -@@ largest economy can ex@@ tric@@ ate itself from its hom@@ em@@ ade defl@@ ation tra@@ p to generate the demand needed to off@@ set economic weak@@ ness else@@ where in the world.
F@@ our years of defl@@ ation and a draw@@ n@@ -@@ out banking crisis offer little prospect of economic stimul@@ us.
H@@ igh@@ er oil prices and lower trade tur@@ no@@ ver ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ate the problem.
But high oil prices thre@@ aten the health of the entire $@@ 4@@ 5 trillion world economy.
O@@ il prices have f@@ li@@ r@@ ted with their highest level since the Gul@@ f War and will go higher if Iraq@@ 's oil infrastructure (or that of neighbor@@ ing countri@@ es@@ ) is dam@@ age@@ d.
The ad@@ verse effects on growth will be fel@@ t every@@ wher@@ e, but no@@ where mor@@ e, perh@@ ap@@ s, than in the energ@@ y-@@ dependent South Korea and China.
Although China's official growth rate reached 8% in 200@@ 2, its high budget deficit and large stock of non-@@ per@@ form@@ ing loans (@@ about 40% of GDP@@ ) mean that it cannot afford any slow@@ down if it is to keep people employ@@ ed, especially in rural are@@ as.
Some poor economies will be directly dam@@ aged by the loss of the Iraq market, which accoun@@ ts for roughly 40% of Vietnam@@ 's te@@ a exports and 20% of its ri@@ ce export@@ s.
For other@@ s, weak@@ ness in the world's big economies may be com@@ po@@ unded by political risk@@ s.
Turkey has suff@@ ered from rising oil prices, falling tou@@ ris@@ m income (@@ its sec@@ ond@@ -@@ largest source of foreign exchan@@ ge@@ ), and decl@@ ining foreign invest@@ ment.
Now the Erdo@@ g@@ an government@@ 's lu@@ ke@@ war@@ m support for US policy on Iraq ex@@ poses Turkey to doub@@ ts about America's commitment to its economic well bein@@ g, and global markets may question its ability to service its $@@ 100 billion public-@@ sector debt in 2003 and 200@@ 4.
The test of whether multilateral cooperation can be put back on tra@@ ck@@ , and re@@ conc@@ il@@ ed with America's war against terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruc@@ tion, may come with Iraq@@ 's re@@ construc@@ tion.
With the costs of ou@@ sting Saddam Hus@@ sein and occup@@ ying Iraq likely to run at any@@ where from $@@ 100 to $@@ 6@@ 00 billion over the next deca@@ de, the US will want to "@@ internation@@ aliz@@ e@@ " Iraq@@ 's re@@ construc@@ tion.
Iraq@@ 's $@@ 20 billion annual oil revenu@@ es cannot meet such cost@@ s.
Indeed, those revenu@@ es will scar@@ c@@ ely cover the costs of re@@ building basic infrastructu@@ re, fe@@ ed@@ ing and housing disp@@ l@@ ac@@ ed popul@@ ations, and pa@@ ying for the country's civil administ@@ ra@@ tion.
After the ou@@ ster of the Taliban last year, the $@@ 4@@ .@@ 5 billion of re@@ construction aid p@@ led@@ ged to Afghanist@@ an@@ 's new government demonstrat@@ ed that a multilateral approach to re@@ construction is possible.
But the po@@ is@@ oned at@@ mosph@@ ere that followed the UN deb@@ ates on Iraq may prevent the US from getting its way her@@ e.
Al@@ read@@ y, French President J@@ acqu@@ es Chi@@ ra@@ c has promised to ve@@ to any Security Council res@@ olution on re@@ construction that seek@@ s to justi@@ fy the war.
If the world economy is to reco@@ ver, the diplomatic fail@@ ures and nam@@ e-@@ call@@ ing must end.
M@@ OS@@ CO@@ W – In a recent inter@@ view, Russia’s President D@@ mit@@ ri Med@@ ve@@ de@@ v proc@@ la@@ im@@ ed that he wants a second term in office following the 2012 elec@@ tion, but that he would not run against Prime Minister Vladimir Put@@ in, who put him in power in the first plac@@ e.
Such a ri@@ val@@ ry, Med@@ ve@@ de@@ v imp@@ li@@ ed, would damage the country’s well-@@ being and ima@@ ge.
Med@@ ve@@ dev@@ ’s stat@@ ement should end spec@@ ulation about whether he is run@@ n@@ ing, yet it ke@@ ep@@ s the susp@@ ense ali@@ ve regar@@ ding Put@@ in, whose influence is far greater than that of Russia’s me@@ ek presid@@ ent.
Man@@ y, particularly in the Wes@@ t, would like to see Putin and his pri@@ ck@@ ly, anti-@@ Western author@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism p@@ ass from the sc@@ en@@ e.
Indeed, over the last ten years, Russian foreign policy has been anim@@ ated by def@@ ensi@@ ven@@ ess and susp@@ ici@@ on.
Russia even has un@@ easy relations with the con@@ gen@@ it@@ ally non-@@ threat@@ ening European Union.
It is tou@@ ch@@ y about the independence of the ne@@ ar-@@ ab@@ road countries, especially those politically or geo@@ graph@@ ically close to the West – Bel@@ ar@@ us, M@@ ol@@ do@@ v@@ a, Ukra@@ ine, and Georgi@@ a.
More than a decade after the fact, the Kremlin still de@@ cri@@ es NATO@@ ’s e@@ ast@@ ward enlar@@ gement as a security threat@@ .
The re@@ ality, of course, is that NATO is as much of an offen@@ sive threat to Russia as S@@ wi@@ tz@@ er@@ land is.
But it is not NATO@@ ’s military power that Putin’s Kremlin fin@@ ds al@@ arm@@ ing@@ ; the real threat is the alli@@ anc@@ e’s potential to “@@ s@@ wal@@ low@@ ” M@@ ol@@ do@@ v@@ a or Ukraine at some poin@@ t.
C@@ re@@ ating a preced@@ ent for the democrati@@ zation of post-@@ Soviet space is a ni@@ gh@@ t@@ m@@ are scenari@@ o for Putin and his c@@ ron@@ i@@ es.
As in Soviet tim@@ es, the main task of today’s ruling eli@@ te – Putin and his former K@@ G@@ B associ@@ ates – is to preser@@ ve their ti@@ gh@@ t-@@ kn@@ it political and economic regi@@ me, built for their personal control and materi@@ al benef@@ it.
Russian foreign policy is, as it was under the Sovi@@ et@@ s, an exten@@ sion of official domestic priori@@ ties.
The current regime is clearly auto@@ c@@ rati@@ c.
Yet it as@@ pi@@ res to democratic legitimacy in the ey@@ es of Russian citizens and the international commun@@ ity.
It is to this end that Med@@ ve@@ de@@ v per@@ forms his civili@@ zing mission – particip@@ ating in world for@@ um@@ s, post@@ ing T@@ wit@@ ter up@@ dat@@ es, ber@@ ating ra@@ mp@@ ant corrup@@ tion, and suppor@@ ting “@@ moderni@@ z@@ ation@@ ” and the “@@ rule of law@@ .”
The result of this du@@ ality – authoritarian establish@@ ment and Po@@ tem@@ k@@ in V@@ il@@ lage democratic fa@@ ç@@ ade – is that Russia occup@@ ies a uni@@ que geo@@ political no man@@ ’s land.
A democratic Russia would want to cat@@ ch up with the West and inte@@ gr@@ ate into Western institutions.
Yet this is not in the group interests of Putin’s back@@ ers, the people who run@@ , and ow@@ n, Russi@@ a@@ : its security, milit@@ ary, and industrial comp@@ lex@@ .
Of course, these people have been person@@ ally integ@@ rated into Europe for two decades now – their money is in European bank@@ s; their ho@@ li@@ day v@@ ill@@ as are in the sou@@ th of France, T@@ us@@ can@@ y, and the Greek is@@ l@@ es; their children are educ@@ ated in the po@@ sh@@ est bo@@ ar@@ ding school@@ s.
So, despite the current regi@@ me@@ ’s t@@ ough@@ , often anti-@@ Western rhetor@@ ic@@ , they are not at all interest@@ ed in clos@@ ing Russia off from the Wes@@ t.
What they want is to prevent the integration with the West of Russia itself@@ , for that would mean the end of their regi@@ me.
But, to su@@ sta@@ in the char@@ ade of a strong and prosper@@ ous Russia, standing against the pre@@ d@@ ations and hy@@ po@@ cri@@ s@@ y of the Wes@@ t, the regime cannot be as authoritarian as Putin himself might wi@@ sh@@ .
If it wer@@ e, S@@ wis@@ s banks and international organizations would close their do@@ or@@ s.
So the regi@@ me@@ ’s back@@ ers have a strong interest in maintain@@ ing its “@@ democrati@@ c@@ ” si@@ de.
The Wes@@ t, despite its years of experience in de@@ aling with the Sovi@@ et@@ s, is still a su@@ ck@@ er for such J@@ an@@ us@@ -@@ like behavi@@ or, especially now, when Med@@ ve@@ de@@ v pres@@ ents such an en@@ de@@ aring democratic fac@@ e.
In Jun@@ e, spe@@ aking at the S@@ t. Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g Economic For@@ um, Med@@ ve@@ de@@ v mes@@ m@@ eri@@ zed his au@@ di@@ ence by si@@ mul@@ tane@@ ously so@@ und@@ ing av@@ ant@@ -@@ gar@@ de and h@@ ack@@ ne@@ y@@ ed@@ : he attack@@ ed corrup@@ tion, vo@@ w@@ ed that Russia is not “@@ building state capit@@ alism@@ ,” and promised legal and federal reform@@ s.
D@@ eci@@ sions, he sa@@ id, should be left to business or made lo@@ call@@ y, not in the Krem@@ lin@@ .
The S@@ t. Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g Economic For@@ um is mostly for international consump@@ tion.
If Western bank@@ ers and investors want to buy s@@ n@@ ake o@@ il, that is their bus@@ ines@@ s.
But no one should leave such events thinking that anything Med@@ ve@@ de@@ v sa@@ ys means that Russia is chang@@ ing.
US Vi@@ ce President J@@ o@@ e B@@ id@@ en, usually a sharp cri@@ tic of Russia, ar@@ ri@@ ved in Mosco@@ w in Mar@@ ch, sup@@ pos@@ edly to con@@ vin@@ ce Putin to sur@@ ren@@ der his presidential ambi@@ tions for 201@@ 2.
A month later, tal@@ king to Putin by ph@@ one, Bi@@ den inv@@ ited him to visit Washingt@@ on, though@@ , according to Russia’s constitu@@ tion, the prime minister has no foreign-@@ policy ro@@ le.
Do@@ es the United States support Putin in the elec@@ tions, or, by recogni@@ zing Putin’s histor@@ ic import@@ ance, do the Americans mean to con@@ vin@@ ce him to leave power@@ ?
No one know@@ s.
Un@@ til Russia’s internal political situation chan@@ ges, relations with the West will remain un@@ changed and am@@ big@@ u@@ ous.
Put@@ in, however, would be well advis@@ ed to li@@ sten to B@@ id@@ en, who is ru@@ mor@@ ed to have offered him important international posi@@ tions, such as ch@@ air@@ ing the International Olymp@@ ic Commit@@ te@@ e, or perhaps even leading the United Nation@@ s.
After all, Putin knows well the old Soviet play@@ book@@ : the f@@ ate of previous K@@ G@@ B func@@ tion@@ aries may a@@ wa@@ it him@@ .
D@@ rea@@ ded secre@@ t-@@ police ch@@ ief L@@ av@@ r@@ ent@@ i B@@ eri@@ a, who oper@@ ated the mach@@ in@@ er@@ y of repres@@ sion under J@@ ose@@ p@@ h St@@ al@@ in, was ex@@ ec@@ uted by the system he perf@@ ec@@ ted, after being sent@@ enc@@ ed to death in 195@@ 3 for “@@ sp@@ ying against the stat@@ e.”
In his decade in power, Putin has consolid@@ ated and strength@@ ened the security forc@@ es, in@@ tim@@ id@@ ated and j@@ ail@@ ed oppon@@ ents, and mu@@ zz@@ led the media and cour@@ ts.
If he do@@ es@@ n’t step down or asi@@ de so that Russia can move for@@ war@@ d, the system he has created may turn his own metho@@ ds against him@@ .
Res@@ pon@@ ses to America’s call for democracy in the Middle East have been te@@ p@@ id at bes@@ t.
Arab governments feel provo@@ ked by President George W. Bush@@ , particularly as he announced his initi@@ ative with little regional con@@ sul@@ t@@ ation.
Se@@ ek@@ ing to pre-@@ emp@@ t American ac@@ tion, Egypt backed a counter@@ -@@ propos@@ al, the A@@ lex@@ and@@ ri@@ a Dec@@ lar@@ ation, at an Arab Le@@ ague summit last Ma@@ y, and followed this with President H@@ os@@ ni Mubarak@@ ’s recent announc@@ ement that he will allow opposition candidates to challenge him for the presiden@@ cy.
Is this just another st@@ all@@ ing tac@@ tic@@ , or an opening to real reform@@ ?
What is clear is that the recent elections in Iraq and Palest@@ ine, together with the s@@ well@@ ing protests against Syri@@ a’s di@@ stor@@ ting influence on Leban@@ on’s democracy, have rein@@ vi@@ g@@ or@@ ated debate about political reform within Egyp@@ t.
M@@ em@@ bers of the opposition have argued that the country is comp@@ ell@@ ed to reform itself if it is not to have reform imposed from ab@@ road@@ .
Go@@ ing fur@@ ther, the man@@ aging direc@@ tor of one newspap@@ er claims that del@@ a@@ ying political and constitutional reform as if it were a g@@ rant to citizens – rather than their right – would inv@@ ite outside intervention in Egyp@@ t’s domestic affair@@ s.
Arab democracy, he claim@@ s, has now become a domestic concern in the United States, which will make it hard for American presid@@ ents to s@@ we@@ ep the ab@@ uses of friend@@ ly Arab regimes under the ru@@ g, as they did in the past@@ .
In the Arab world, authoritarian governments have de@@ priv@@ ed people of politic@@ al, ci@@ vil@@ , and intellectual freedom@@ s for decades.
For young citiz@@ ens, particularly Islam@@ ist@@ s, normal chan@@ n@@ els of political particip@@ ation have been clos@@ ed off@@ .
As a result, they have gra@@ vit@@ ated towards under@@ ground extrem@@ ist movem@@ ents.
P@@ over@@ ty, c@@ ron@@ y@@ ism, and official corruption hei@@ gh@@ ten this popular fru@@ stra@@ tion.
In this clim@@ ate, the moment@@ um for political and constitutional reform in Egypt is ga@@ ther@@ ing p@@ ac@@ e.
There is great no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a for the last liberal experi@@ ment (@@ from the 19@@ 20@@ ’s until the 195@@ 2 Revolu@@ tion@@ ), which was a model for other Arab countries.
Egyp@@ t’s vi@@ b@@ rant political lif@@ e, pres@@ s, and liberal culture were then supported by an ide@@ ology of sec@@ ular nation@@ alism and improved religious har@@ mon@@ y.
There was a vi@@ b@@ rant multi@@ party parliamentary democracy, with an independent judi@@ ci@@ ary and one of the world’s ear@@ li@@ est movem@@ ents for f@@ em@@ ale em@@ an@@ cip@@ ation.
The achiev@@ ements and as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions of that liberal experi@@ ment today un@@ ite Egypti@@ ans who favor reform@@ .
They have even inspi@@ red the bir@@ th of a new political par@@ ty, H@@ iz@@ b al g@@ had (the Party of T@@ om@@ or@@ row@@ ), fo@@ unded by a young parliament@@ arian committed to democratic reform@@ .
The party den@@ ies the argument that democracy will fo@@ ster Islamic extre@@ mis@@ m and claims that it is the del@@ ay of reform that pres@@ ents a major source of danger@@ .
H@@ iz@@ b al g@@ had recently produced a 4@@ 8@@ -@@ p@@ age dra@@ ft constitu@@ tion, aimed at revi@@ ving Egyp@@ t’s stag@@ n@@ ant political life.
Its pre@@ am@@ ble, which op@@ ens with the ph@@ ra@@ se “@@ W@@ e, the Egypti@@ an peop@@ le@@ ,” can be re@@ ad as a sc@@ a@@ thing attack on Egyp@@ t’s current political or@@ der, and calls for an end to fear and des@@ po@@ ti@@ sm@@ .
Am@@ ong the docum@@ ent@@ ’s propos@@ als is an end to the emer@@ gency rule imposed since President An@@ war Sad@@ at@@ ’s ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation in 198@@ 1.
That seem@@ ingly end@@ less “@@ emer@@ gen@@ cy@@ ” has resul@@ ted in the severe restric@@ tion, or even sus@@ pen@@ sion, of individual and political liber@@ ties.
Other provi@@ sions include cur@@ bing the f@@ ar-@@ reach@@ ing powers gran@@ ted to the President in the 197@@ 1 constitu@@ tion and introduc@@ ing direct presidential elections with multi@@ ple candid@@ at@@ es.
The dra@@ ft constitu@@ tion would trans@@ form Egypt into a parliamentary re@@ public@@ .
The domin@@ ant National Democratic Party (@@ N@@ DP@@ ) takes a different view, argu@@ ing that political change can be achieved without constitutional reform@@ .
The N@@ D@@ P appears to believe that democrati@@ zation must begin with changing the political culture and in@@ still@@ ing democratic valu@@ es.
These steps would prec@@ e@@ de con@@ cre@@ te legal and constitutional reform@@ s, such as those proposed by H@@ iz@@ b al g@@ ha@@ d.
So f@@ ar, however, the N@@ D@@ P has mis@@ sed every opportunity imag@@ in@@ able to gain popular support by propos@@ ing a reform program designed to bring real increases in public particip@@ ation.
This is one reason why Mubarak@@ ’s call to hold a multi@@ -@@ candidate presidential election failed to g@@ al@@ v@@ ani@@ ze Egyp@@ t’s elector@@ ate.
The government, indeed, pre@@ f@@ ers to offer only hol@@ low initi@@ atives focused nar@@ row@@ ly on the economy.
The conflict between the two vi@@ sions of reform should not ob@@ sc@@ ure the fact that there is a general consensus in Egyp@@ t: substantial reform of some kind is necessary and long over@@ du@@ e.
Most importantly, liberal vo@@ ic@@ es in Egypt are not merely a response to US democratic initi@@ ativ@@ es.
They are a hom@@ e@@ grow@@ n challenge to an ent@@ ren@@ ched political or@@ der, and they are ri@@ ding a powerful historical curr@@ ent.
I am wri@@ ting this in New York in early Au@@ gu@@ st, when the ma@@ y@@ or declared a “@@ he@@ at emer@@ gen@@ cy@@ ” to prevent widespread electric@@ ity out@@ ages from the expected high use of air condi@@ tion@@ ers.
C@@ ity employ@@ e@@ es could face crimin@@ al charg@@ es if they set their ther@@ mo@@ stat@@ s below 7@@ 8 degre@@ es F@@ ahr@@ enheit (@@ 25@@ .@@ 5 C@@ el@@ si@@ us@@ ).
Nevertheless, electric@@ ity us@@ age has reached ne@@ ar-@@ record level@@ s.
Mean@@ while C@@ aliforni@@ a has emerg@@ ed from its own rec@@ ord@@ -@@ break@@ ing he@@ at wa@@ ve.
For the United States as a whol@@ e, the first six months of 2006 were the ho@@ tt@@ est in more than a century.
Europe is experienc@@ ing an un@@ usually ho@@ t su@@ mm@@ er, to@@ o.
Ju@@ ly set new rec@@ or@@ ds in Eng@@ land and the Ne@@ ther@@ land@@ s, where we@@ a@@ ther data go back more than 300 years.
The ho@@ t nor@@ thern sum@@ mer f@@ its well with the re@@ le@@ ase of An In@@ conven@@ i@@ ent Tru@@ th, a docum@@ ent@@ ary fil@@ m feat@@ uring former US V@@ ic@@ e-@@ President Al Gor@@ e.
U@@ sing some remark@@ able graph@@ s, ima@@ ges, and other inform@@ ation, the fil@@ m makes a comp@@ elling case that our carbon di@@ ox@@ ide emissions are caus@@ ing global warm@@ ing, or, at the very lea@@ st, contribut@@ ing to it, and that we must urg@@ ently address the issu@@ e.
Americans tend to talk a lot about mor@@ ality and j@@ us@@ tic@@ e.
But most Americans still fail to re@@ alize that their country’s ref@@ us@@ al to sign the Kyoto pro@@ to@@ col@@ , and their sub@@ sequ@@ ent business@@ –@@ as@@ -@@ us@@ ual approach to green@@ house gas emis@@ sions, is a moral fail@@ ing of the most serious kin@@ d.
It is already having har@@ m@@ ful consequences for other@@ s, and the greatest inequ@@ ity is that it is the rich who are using most of the energy that lead@@ s to the emissions that cause climate change, while it is the poor who will be@@ ar most of the cost@@ s.
(@@ To see what you can do to reduce your own contribu@@ tion, go to w@@ w@@ w@@ .@@ clim@@ at@@ ec@@ risi@@ s@@ .@@ net@@ .)
To see the inequ@@ ity, I merely have to gl@@ ance up at the air condi@@ tion@@ er that is ke@@ eping my office be@@ arab@@ le.
While I@@ ’@@ ve done more than the ma@@ y@@ or re@@ ques@@ ted, set@@ ting it at 8@@ 2@@ F (@@ 2@@ 7@@ C@@ ), I@@ ’@@ m still part of a fe@@ ed@@ back lo@@ op@@ .
I deal with the he@@ at by using more energ@@ y, which lead@@ s to bur@@ ning more fossi@@ l fuel@@ , put@@ ting more green@@ house gas@@ es into the at@@ mosph@@ ere and he@@ ating up the plan@@ et more.
It even happened when I wat@@ ched An In@@ conven@@ i@@ ent Tru@@ th@@ : on a war@@ m ev@@ en@@ ing, the c@@ in@@ em@@ a was so chil@@ ly that I wi@@ shed I had brought a j@@ ack@@ et.
He@@ at kill@@ s.
A he@@ at wa@@ ve in France in 2003 caused an estimated 3@@ 5@@ ,000 death@@ s, and a ho@@ t sp@@ ell similar to the one Britain had last month caused more than 2@@ ,000 death@@ s, according to official estim@@ at@@ es.
Although no particular he@@ at wa@@ ve can be directly at@@ tri@@ but@@ ed to global warm@@ ing, it will make such events more frequ@@ ent.
Moreover, if global warming continues un@@ ch@@ eck@@ ed, the number of death@@ s that occ@@ ur when ra@@ in@@ fall becomes more er@@ rati@@ c, caus@@ ing both pro@@ lon@@ ged d@@ rough@@ ts and severe flo@@ od@@ s, will d@@ war@@ f the death t@@ ol@@ l from ho@@ t we@@ a@@ ther in Europe.
More frequ@@ ent inten@@ se hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es will k@@ ill many more.
M@@ el@@ ting pol@@ ar ice will cause rising se@@ as to in@@ und@@ ate low-@@ lying fer@@ ti@@ le del@@ ta regions on which hundreds of millions of people grow their fo@@ od.
Tro@@ pi@@ cal diseas@@ es will spread@@ , kill@@ ing still more people.
O@@ ver@@ wh@@ elm@@ ing@@ ly, the de@@ ad will be those who lack the resources to adap@@ t, to find alternative sources of fo@@ od, and who do not have access to health car@@ e.
Even in rich countries, it usually is@@ n’t the rich who die in natural disa@@ ster@@ s.
When H@@ ur@@ ri@@ can@@ e Kat@@ rin@@ a hit New Or@@ le@@ ans, those who died were the poor in low-@@ lying areas who lack@@ ed car@@ s to es@@ cap@@ e.
If this is true in a country like the US, with a reason@@ ably efficient infrastructure and the resources to help its citizens in times of crisis, it is even more evi@@ dent when disa@@ st@@ ers stri@@ ke developing countries, because their governments lack the resources nee@@ ded, and bec@@ aus@@ e, when it comes to foreign assi@@ st@@ ance, rich nations still do not coun@@ t all human lives equ@@ ally.
According to United Nations fig@@ ures, in 2002 per capita emissions of green@@ house gas@@ es in the US were 1@@ 6 times higher than in India, 60 times higher than in Bang@@ lad@@ es@@ h@@ , and more than 200 times higher than in Eth@@ i@@ op@@ i@@ a, M@@ ali@@ , or Cha@@ d.
Other developed nations with emissions close to those of the US include Australi@@ a, Can@@ ad@@ a, and Lu@@ x@@ em@@ bo@@ ur@@ g.
Russia, Germany, Britain@@ , Ital@@ y, France, and Spain all have levels between a half and a quar@@ ter that of the US.
This is still significantly above the world aver@@ age, and more than 50 times that of the poorest nations in which people will die from global warm@@ ing.
If a poll@@ u@@ ter har@@ ms other@@ s, those who are har@@ m@@ ed norm@@ ally have a legal re@@ m@@ ed@@ y.
For example, if a fac@@ tory le@@ ak@@ s tox@@ ic chem@@ ic@@ als into a ri@@ ver that I use to ir@@ rig@@ ate my farm@@ , kill@@ ing my c@@ ro@@ p@@ s, I can su@@ e the fac@@ tory ow@@ n@@ er.
If the rich nations poll@@ ute the at@@ mosph@@ ere with carbon di@@ ox@@ i@@ de, caus@@ ing my c@@ ro@@ ps to fail because of changing ra@@ in@@ fall pat@@ tern@@ s, or my fiel@@ ds are in@@ und@@ ated by a rise in the se@@ a level@@ , sh@@ oul@@ d@@ n’t I also be able to su@@ e?
Cam@@ ill@@ a T@@ oul@@ min@@ , who direc@@ ts the International Institu@@ te for En@@ viron@@ ment and Develop@@ ment, a L@@ on@@ don@@ -@@ based NG@@ O@@ , was present at a lec@@ ture on climate change that Al Gor@@ e gave in Jun@@ e.
S@@ he asked him what he thought about compens@@ ation for those who are hit har@@ dest by climate change, but who have done the least to cause it.
The ques@@ tion, she repor@@ ts on w@@ w@@ w@@ .@@ open@@ democrac@@ y@@ .@@ net, seemed to take him by surpri@@ se, and he did not support the ide@@ a.
Like T@@ oul@@ min@@ , I won@@ der if this is a truth that is just too in@@ conven@@ i@@ ent, even for him@@ .
America’s defense policy is at a cros@@ s@@ road@@ s.
Since 199@@ 7, the United States Congress has required the De@@ part@@ ment of Def@@ ense to under@@ take a major defense re@@ view every four years.
The de@@ part@@ ment is currently developing the third such re@@ view and will re@@ le@@ ase it later this year.
The re@@ view promises to be nothing short of a w@@ ater@@ sh@@ ed.
The last Qu@@ ad@@ ren@@ ni@@ al Def@@ ense Re@@ view was publi@@ shed a few week@@ s after the September 1@@ 1, 2001, terrorist attack@@ s. As a result, it gave only hin@@ ts of the counter@@ terrorism strategy to come.
The 2005 re@@ view, by contrast, will repres@@ ent several years of thinking by the Bush administ@@ ration, and thus will serve as a key indic@@ ator of the future course of American defense policy.
The gr@@ and strategy that ser@@ ves as the found@@ ation for American defense policy has not under@@ gone major change since 200@@ 2.
F@@ oc@@ using on terror@@ ism, the strategy calls for strength@@ ening the net@@ work of international partn@@ ers seeking to er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate trans@@ national terror@@ ism, and for direct action against terrorist organizations and their sp@@ on@@ sor@@ s.
U@@ l@@ tim@@ ately, it seek@@ s to address what President Bush consi@@ ders the ro@@ ot causes of terror@@ ism, particularly the absence of open political systems and economic opport@@ un@@ ity.
What is changing is the way that US military power is used to imp@@ lement this gr@@ and strateg@@ y.
There is little doubt that the 2005 Def@@ ense Re@@ view will for@@ mali@@ ze the change in focus under@@ way since September 1@@ 1, 200@@ 1.
Be@@ fore that, the American military concent@@ rated on s@@ wi@@ ft victory in a major the@@ ater war against another stat@@ e’s military forc@@ es.
Today, however, the US military is more likely to be used to stabili@@ ze and re@@ build failed states, assi@@ st partn@@ ers in counter@@ ing insur@@ gency and terror@@ ism, control nuclear weapons when regimes collap@@ se, or directly er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate terrorist organizations and their suppor@@ ters.
This requires a different type of forc@@ e, and one capable of running a mar@@ ath@@ on rather than a sp@@ rin@@ t, sustain@@ ing major dep@@ loy@@ ments for exten@@ ded peri@@ od@@ s.
The global conf@@ ig@@ u@@ ration of America’s military is also chang@@ ing.
The goal is to keep most of the force st@@ ation@@ ed at home in the US, with a net@@ work of ligh@@ tl@@ y-@@ man@@ ned bas@@ es ab@@ road that can serve as forward oper@@ ating loc@@ ations during a crisis or war.
Ra@@ ther than being min@@ iat@@ ure Americ@@ as, many of these bas@@ es will be oper@@ ated in con@@ j@@ unc@@ tion with or by the ho@@ st nation@@ .
This will capit@@ alize on the US milit@@ ar@@ y’s ability to project force around the world quick@@ ly, while providing a more flexi@@ ble and politically pal@@ at@@ able way of doing so@@ . 
But, beyond the ongoing chan@@ ges, major strategic questions persi@@ st.
First, how much conventional war@@ -@@ fighting cap@@ ability should the US military re@@ tain@@ ?
The goal is to maintain enough to de@@ ter aggres@@ sor@@ s, but not so much that it de@@ trac@@ ts from o@@ ther, more likely mission@@ s.
Second, what will America’s relationship with its traditional allies be@@ ?
Will form@@ al alli@@ ances such as NATO remain the cent@@ er@@ pi@@ ec@@ e of American strateg@@ y, or will they be super@@ se@@ ded by mission@@ -@@ specific co@@ ali@@ tions@@ ?
Thir@@ d, how much should the US continue to invest in adv@@ anc@@ ed, high-@@ te@@ ch weapons more appropriate for conventional enem@@ ies than for fighting terror@@ ists or insur@@ g@@ ent@@ s?
Systems such as the F@@ /@@ A@@ -@@ 2@@ 2 R@@ ap@@ tor air@@ cra@@ ft and the Arm@@ y’s F@@ ut@@ ure Com@@ b@@ at System are extra@@ ordin@@ arily exp@@ ensi@@ ve.
At a time when dep@@ loy@@ ments to Iraq and Afghanistan are stra@@ ining the defense budget and much of the milit@@ ar@@ y’s existing equi@@ p@@ ment needs re@@ pa@@ ir or re@@ plac@@ em@@ ent, questions ar@@ ise as to whether such programs are a good invest@@ ment.
F@@ our@@ th, what is the appropriate size of the US milit@@ ar@@ y?
Many defense intellec@@ tu@@ als, former military leader@@ s, and politicians believe that America’s milit@@ ary, particularly the ground forc@@ es, are too small to imp@@ lement Bush’s gr@@ and strateg@@ y@@ . 
Secretary of Def@@ ense D@@ onald R@@ ums@@ fel@@ d, on the other hand, believ@@ es the size of the military is adequate if it is re-@@ organiz@@ ed for ma@@ xim@@ um effici@@ enc@@ y. He is also concerned that an increase in the size of the military will dimin@@ ish funds available for advanced technology and system@@ s.
Because R@@ ums@@ feld is the primary arch@@ it@@ ect of the up@@ coming defense re@@ view, it is very unlikely to re@@ commen@@ d an increase in the size of the forc@@ e.
The changes under@@ way in American defense policy reflect plann@@ ing assu@@ mp@@ tions.
The strategy that emerg@@ es will be only as strong as these assu@@ mp@@ tions are ac@@ cur@@ at@@ e@@ . 
The up@@ coming defense re@@ view will mand@@ ate changes based on events of the past five years, foc@@ using especially on Iraq, Afghanistan, and other asp@@ ec@@ ts of the war on terror@@ .
The question is whether future American military mis@@ sions will rep@@ lic@@ ate those of the past five year@@ s@@ . 
If not, the US might be prepar@@ ing for the last war rather than the next one.
One hop@@ es that the 2005 Def@@ ense Re@@ view will address this issu@@ e, although it is certain to answer some strategic questions and leave others open to continued deb@@ ate.
In any case, the new re@@ view will serve as a road@@ ma@@ p for future US defense policy, thus affec@@ ting America’s partn@@ ers and ad@@ vers@@ aries ali@@ k@@ e.
T@@ O@@ K@@ Y@@ O – The scale of the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ i that stru@@ ck Japan in Mar@@ ch was far greater than even the authori@@ ti@@ es’ worst scenari@@ os for@@ es@@ aw@@ .
N@@ early six months later, the total damage remains difficult to estim@@ ate.
Social un@@ rest and con@@ fu@@ sion, as well as radi@@ ation le@@ ak@@ s from the Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a nuclear power plan@@ t, continu@@ e.
And now the country has ab@@ sor@@ bed another huge b@@ low@@ : another down@@ gra@@ de of its bond rat@@ ings.
Both Mo@@ od@@ y’s and Stand@@ ard &amp@@ ; Po@@ or@@ ’s now rate Japanese bonds at only their fo@@ ur@@ th@@ -@@ highest level@@ .
So what policies should be implement@@ ed in response to these economic b@@ low@@ s?
Last year, Japan’s economy gre@@ w at a relatively health@@ y 3% annual rat@@ e, higher than in the United States or the European Union, owing mainly to the fiscal expansion under@@ taken after the collapse of Leh@@ man Bro@@ thers in 2008@@ .
But growth in 2011 had been predic@@ ted to slow even before the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ak@@ e.
Indeed, the economy shr@@ ank by 3.@@ 5% year on year in the first quar@@ ter.
N@@ ow, with so much fix@@ ed capital and infrastructure destro@@ yed by the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ i, the econom@@ y’s productive capacity has fallen by an estimated 2% of GDP.
But that may not be a bad th@@ ing@@ : Pri@@ or to the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ak@@ e, Japan had a dem@@ and@@ -@@ supply gap of appro@@ xim@@ ately 5% of GDP.
While reducing this gap to 3% of GDP has led to higher prices, this is exac@@ tly what Japan needs after years of persi@@ st@@ ent defl@@ ation.
Meanwhile, higher public spending on capital investment and other special proc@@ u@@ re@@ ments will boost domestic dem@@ and.
The H@@ an@@ sh@@ in ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake in 199@@ 5 destro@@ yed capital stock worth 2% of GDP.
This time, the loss is estimated at 3.@@ 4% of GDP@@ , im@@ pl@@ ying a larger increase in domestic demand if the right public policies are pursu@@ ed.
On the down@@ si@@ de, confidence among consum@@ ers and investors ali@@ ke has taken a h@@ it, mainly owing to fear@@ s about radi@@ ation le@@ ak@@ ages and power short@@ ag@@ es.
According to the Japan Cent@@ er for Economic Res@@ ear@@ ch, power@@ -@@ supply dis@@ rup@@ tions could neg@@ ati@@ vely aff@@ ect the Japanese economy for the next three years.
If the T@@ ok@@ y@@ o met@@ ro@@ poli@@ t@@ an are@@ a’s power supply were to de@@ creas@@ e by 10% this year, for example, Japan’s GDP would fall by 2@@ %.
So@@ on after the disa@@ st@@ er, the government announced that re@@ construction demand and higher prices would bring about relatively rapid economic recover@@ y.
I think this view is too optim@@ istic@@ , because I susp@@ ect that the government wants to finance its new expendi@@ ture with a tax hi@@ k@@ e.
Moreover, the extrem@@ ely sharp contrac@@ tion in fir@@ st-@@ quar@@ ter GDP may indic@@ ate that the disa@@ ster@@ ’s negative impact on the economy was more significant than expec@@ ted.
Indeed, the economy is expected to have shr@@ un@@ k by another 2.@@ 6% year on year in the second quar@@ ter, with growth set to res@@ um@@ e only in Jul@@ y-@@ Septem@@ ber@@ .
And, contr@@ ary to the government’s out@@ look@@ , the start of economic recovery could be del@@ a@@ yed until the end of this year, with medi@@ um@@ -@@ term annual growth reach@@ ing 1.@@ 5@@ - 2@@ %.
A key question has been the disa@@ ster@@ ’s impact on global supply ch@@ ain@@ s.
According to Japan’s Minist@@ ry of Econom@@ y, Tra@@ de, and In@@ dust@@ ry, which sur@@ ve@@ yed firms roughly a month after the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ak@@ e, more than 60@@ % of production si@@ tes in affec@@ ted areas had already recover@@ ed as of April 15@@ .
Al@@ most 3@@ 0% expected to reco@@ ver by the su@@ mm@@ er, and the rema@@ ining 10% for@@ es@@ a@@ w normal oper@@ ations after the aut@@ um@@ n.
But the impact of even a small number of dis@@ rup@@ tions to supply ch@@ ain@@ s can be highly signific@@ ant, particularly for the Asi@@ a-@@ P@@ aci@@ fic region.
Consider Ren@@ es@@ as E@@ lec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic@@ s, a medi@@ um@@ -@@ size comp@@ an@@ y, with ¥@@ 1@@ 50 billion (@@ $@@ 1.@@ 9 billi@@ on@@ ) in annual sal@@ es, which accoun@@ ts for more than half of worldwide production of essential m@@ icro@@ -@@ comp@@ ut@@ ing comp@@ on@@ ents for autom@@ ob@@ il@@ es.
Par@@ tly as a result of the damage at Ren@@ es@@ as, To@@ yo@@ ta@@ ’s capac@@ it@@ y-@@ uti@@ li@@ zation rate dro@@ pped to 50% at the beginning of Ma@@ y.
Likewise, the chem@@ ical manufac@@ tur@@ er Ku@@ re@@ h@@ a (@@ ¥@@ 1@@ 30 billion in annual sal@@ es@@ ) has a 7@@ 0% share of the global market for ad@@ h@@ esi@@ ve materi@@ als for li@@ th@@ i@@ um@@ -@@ i@@ on b@@ at@@ ter@@ ies – a small but essential comp@@ on@@ ent of c@@ ell ph@@ on@@ es.
N@@ ok@@ ia in Fin@@ land, for example, impor@@ ts 1@@ 2% of its c@@ ell@@ -@@ ph@@ one comp@@ on@@ ents from Japan, and thus could be indi@@ rec@@ tly affec@@ ted by the disa@@ st@@ er.
As a result, more companies are likely to create and imp@@ lement business continu@@ ity plan@@ s. Indeed, “@@ B@@ C@@ P@@ ” is set to become a key term in the region’s economic dis@@ cour@@ se.
U@@ sing B@@ C@@ P@@ s to determin@@ e alternative produc@@ ers means that regional economies will be integ@@ rated in a new form@@ , with companies establish@@ ing cooper@@ ative relation@@ ships even with their competi@@ tor@@ s.
Unfortunately, Japan’s public officials appear in@@ capable of similar flexi@@ bilit@@ y.
The disa@@ ster con@@ firm@@ ed the traditional view of Japan as a country that combin@@ es a dynam@@ ic private sector with an an@@ em@@ ic public sector and central administ@@ ra@@ tion.
The government’s mistak@@ es in so-called “@@ risk communic@@ ation@@ ” regar@@ ding the Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a nuclear plan@@ t, and its slow@@ ness in getting necessary aid to people disp@@ l@@ ac@@ ed by the disa@@ st@@ er, have once again put the ster@@ e@@ o@@ type on full disp@@ la@@ y.
In terms of international rel@@ ations, however, the disa@@ ster could improve Japan’s bilateral ties with influ@@ ential countries.
For example, Chinese Pre@@ mi@@ er W@@ en Ji@@ ab@@ a@@ o and South Korean President Le@@ e My@@ ung@@ -@@ b@@ ak met with out@@ going Japanese Prime Minister N@@ a@@ o@@ to K@@ an in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma, near the dam@@ aged pl@@ ant –@@ &nbsp;@@ helping to e@@ ase neighbor@@ ing countries’ concerns about radi@@ ation le@@ ak@@ age.
Moreover, Japan’s relations with the US, which had suff@@ ered since the Democratic Party of Japan came to power two years ago, appear to have emerg@@ ed from the disa@@ ster stronger than ever@@ .
Japan’s Sel@@ f-@@ Def@@ ense For@@ ces played an important role in res@@ c@@ ue and restor@@ ation activi@@ ties, with about half of its 200@@ ,000 person@@ ne@@ l disp@@ at@@ ched to the dam@@ aged are@@ a.
While this sever@@ ely weak@@ ened Japan’s def@@ ens@@ es, the US ensu@@ red East Asi@@ a’s security by dep@@ lo@@ ying an air@@ cra@@ ft car@@ ri@@ er and cru@@ is@@ ers, and American forces also se@@ arch@@ ed for mis@@ sing victim@@ s together with the J@@ S@@ D@@ F@@ .
But Japan’s neighbor@@ s expect rapid re@@ construction and nor@@ ma@@ liz@@ ation, and for that, stronger political leadership is nee@@ ded.
The ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ i have confron@@ ted Japan with a pro@@ found crisis – but also with a r@@ are opportunity to under@@ take the comprehensive reforms that the country has post@@ p@@ oned for far too lon@@ g.
On November 4@@ -@@ 5, the fo@@ ur@@ th Sum@@ mit of the Americ@@ as took place in M@@ ar del Plat@@ a, Argentin@@ a.
The head@@ s of state of the h@@ emis@@ pher@@ e’s democratic countries met to disc@@ uss economic@@ , politic@@ al, and social issues – and to lose another opportunity to create a new and health@@ ier relationship between the United States and its Latin American neighbor@@ s.
Indeed, the Sum@@ mit amoun@@ ted to nothing more than an out@@ si@@ zed p@@ ho@@ to opport@@ un@@ ity.
No important issues were resol@@ v@@ ed, and no progress was made on the many top@@ ics that increasingly divi@@ de the countries of Latin America and the US.
In particul@@ ar, no progress was made on the creation of a fre@@ e-@@ trade area for the region.
This is all the more dis@@ appoin@@ t@@ ing, given that the region’s leaders declared more than a decade ago, during the first Sum@@ mit of the Americ@@ as, held in M@@ i@@ am@@ i in Dec@@ ember 199@@ 4, that fre@@ e-@@ trade negotiations would be “@@ conclu@@ ded no later than 200@@ 5@@ .”
At the center of the failure to make head@@ way on the creation of the Fre@@ e Trade A@@ re@@ a of the Americ@@ as (@@ FT@@ A@@ A@@ ) is America’s un@@ willing@@ n@@ ess, and that of the Bush administ@@ ration, to open up its agricultural sector to competition from countries such as Argentin@@ a, Braz@@ il, and U@@ ru@@ gu@@ a@@ y.
Tru@@ e, the US is not the worst off@@ ender in the world when it comes to far@@ m protection@@ ism@@ ; the European Uni@@ on’s trade di@@ stor@@ tions are significantly more per@@ v@@ asi@@ ve.
But it is also true that if the US wants to improve relations with its neighbor@@ s to the sou@@ th, America should make significant bilateral trade conc@@ es@@ sions to the Latin American countries.
In the absence of US leadership in matters of international tra@@ de, the majority of Latin American countries will not open their economies further to foreign competi@@ tion, and some may even return to increased protection@@ ism.
Unfortunately, the lack of progress on tra@@ de-@@ related issues is not the only burden on relations between the US and Latin Americ@@ a. There are also serious diplomatic and political problems.
Ver@@ y few Latin American countries support the Iraq war@@ ; indeed, only a hand@@ ful of small countries in the region contribut@@ ed troops to the so-called “@@ coalition of the willing@@ ,” and today only E@@ l Sal@@ v@@ ad@@ or still has its troops in Iraq.
More bro@@ ad@@ ly, most Latin American governments are increasingly critical of the Bush administ@@ ration@@ ’s foreign policy, and they are unlikely to support major initi@@ atives in international for@@ um@@ s, including in the United Nation@@ s.
Moreover, a growing number of Latin American countries are ve@@ ering le@@ ft, and Hu@@ go Cháve@@ z, the bel@@ li@@ ger@@ ent and anti-@@ American Venezuel@@ an president, is becoming increasingly popular in every Latin American country.
V@@ o@@ ters across Latin America are becoming skep@@ tical of market@@ -@@ ori@@ ented policies and globaliz@@ ation, making it more likely that in coming years, and under new leader@@ ship, economic policies in the region will be less friend@@ ly to foreign investment in gener@@ al, and to US economic interests in particul@@ ar.
It is not too late for the US to re@@ gain its political and diplomatic influence in Latin Americ@@ a.
But impro@@ ving relations with its neighbor@@ s to the South will require making commit@@ ments at several level@@ s.
Th@@ re@@ e commit@@ ments are particularly import@@ ant. First, US agricultural protection@@ ism should be reduc@@ ed.
Second, immig@@ ration reform in the US should be en@@ ac@@ ted in a way that protec@@ ts the rights of Lat@@ in@@ o mig@@ ran@@ ts. And, thir@@ d, the US should support the demands of Latin American countries for a greater say in international institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund@@ .
These initi@@ atives will give the sign@@ al to Latin American leaders that, despite appe@@ aran@@ ces to the contr@@ ary – including the latest Sum@@ mit of the Americ@@ as – the region has not been comple@@ tel@@ y neg@@ lec@@ ted by President Bush and the US.
W@@ AS@@ HI@@ NG@@ T@@ ON@@ , D@@ C – John Bo@@ ehn@@ er, Spe@@ ak@@ er of the United States Hous@@ e of Re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ativ@@ es, is leading the Republican Par@@ t@@ y’s char@@ ge on fiscal policy, argu@@ ing that his side needs to see “@@ trilli@@ ons of dollar@@ s” in spending cuts in order for Congress to appro@@ ve an increase in the US government’s debt c@@ ei@@ l@@ ing.
But fra@@ m@@ ing the issue this way cre@@ ates a major problem for Bo@@ eh@@ ner@@ : it will direc@@ t@@ ly, comple@@ tel@@ y, and quickly ant@@ ag@@ oni@@ ze one of the Republi@@ can@@ s’ most important constitu@@ en@@ cies – the US corporate sector@@ .
F@@ oc@@ using on the debt c@@ ei@@ ling cre@@ ates a political tra@@ p for Bo@@ eh@@ ner and the Republi@@ can@@ s.
It is true that the US Treas@@ ur@@ y’s ability to bor@@ row will reach its leg@@ ally authori@@ zed limit in early Au@@ gu@@ st.
It is also true that wh@@ en@@ ever Republi@@ c@@ ans rat@@ t@@ le their s@@ ab@@ ers about the debt c@@ ei@@ l@@ ing, and thre@@ aten not to raise it, the bond market y@@ aw@@ ns and there is no significant impact on yiel@@ ds.
If the Republi@@ can@@ s’ threats were credi@@ ble, any news that increased the lik@@ eli@@ hood of a problem with the debt c@@ ei@@ ling would sen@@ d Treasury bond prices down and yiel@@ ds up@@ .
This is not happ@@ en@@ ing, because bond tra@@ ders cannot imag@@ ine that the Republi@@ c@@ ans would be able – or even willing – to follow through@@ .
After all, the consequences of fail@@ ing to increase the debt c@@ ei@@ ling would be c@@ atastroph@@ ic@@ .
The entire credit system in the US – and in much of the rest of the world – is based on the no@@ tion that there are “@@ risk@@ -@@ free asset@@ s@@ ,” nam@@ ely US government securi@@ ties.
There is no provi@@ sion in the US Constitu@@ tion to guarantee that the US will always pay its deb@@ ts, but the American Re@@ public has pro@@ ven itself for 200@@ -@@ pl@@ us years to be about as good a credit risk as has ever exist@@ ed.
US fiscal resol@@ ve has been test@@ ed at least five tim@@ es: at indepen@@ den@@ ce, in the war of 18@@ 1@@ 2, during and after the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l W@@ ar, and in World War I and World War II@@ .
We can debate the ex@@ act fiscal pressu@@ res in each case, and precisely how various kin@@ ds of bond@@ hol@@ ders were treat@@ ed, but the simple fact of the matter is that when the going ge@@ ts t@@ ough@@ , the US pa@@ ys its deb@@ ts.
At least in the near ter@@ m, the chance that the US will not service its debt is v@@ an@@ ish@@ ingly small – perhaps in the same order of prob@@ ability as a large me@@ te@@ or stri@@ king the ear@@ th.
To be sure, there are big fiscal questions to be sor@@ ted out – including how much the government should spend and on wh@@ at, as well as how much tax it should collec@@ t and by what mean@@ s.
There is also the v@@ ex@@ ing question of how much debt is too much for the modern US.
In a world where international investors (@@ from both the private and official sector@@ s) ro@@ ut@@ in@@ ely w@@ ring their hands about US fiscal deficits – and then go out and buy more US government debt – who knows the answer@@ ?
Coun@@ tries never default because they can@@ ’t pay their deb@@ ts@@ ; there are always ways to de@@ creas@@ e expendi@@ tures or raise tax@@ es.
Coun@@ tries default because their political proc@@ esses bring them to the point where the people in power deci@@ de, for whatever reas@@ on, not to pay the government’s deb@@ ts.
It is not difficult to identi@@ fy who would be@@ ar what costs if the US did not pay – or if it dis@@ rup@@ ted markets by not increasing its debt c@@ ei@@ l@@ ing.
E@@ ver@@ y@@ one who bor@@ ro@@ ws or inter@@ ac@@ ts with the credit system in any way would suff@@ er a sho@@ ck that would make the crisis of 2008 look sm@@ all.
Am@@ ong other@@ s, the US corporate sector – big and small business – would be li@@ vi@@ d.
To be sure, execu@@ tives and entrep@@ rene@@ urs like to sh@@ ake their head@@ s over the current US fiscal defic@@ it.
And some of them eng@@ age construc@@ tively in deb@@ ates about the real issu@@ es: how to control health@@ -@@ care cost@@ s, prevent future financial cri@@ ses, and end America’s exp@@ ensive foreign war@@ s.
But these are the issues for the presidential election of 201@@ 2, in which one hop@@ es for deb@@ ates that will set a more encoura@@ ging fiscal agenda for the next 20-@@ 30 years.
How and when America’s budget problems will be resol@@ ved is unk@@ now@@ n, but US fiscal history is encoura@@ ging – the Re@@ public has managed and survi@@ ved crisis befor@@ e.
S@@ imp@@ ly pu@@ t, America will not s@@ core an own goal over the debt c@@ ei@@ ling – and Bo@@ eh@@ ner must know it.
Sy@@ m@@ bo@@ li@@ c gest@@ ures are to be expec@@ ted, as with the threat@@ ened government sh@@ ut@@ down earlier this year, which merely created fo@@ d@@ der for political ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing by both parti@@ es.
But any manufac@@ tured debt crisis now would deeply ant@@ ag@@ oni@@ ze the corporate sector – and most of the elector@@ ate.
In the w@@ ake of economic disa@@ st@@ er, the party held responsible would pres@@ um@@ ably be ex@@ il@@ ed from power for a generation (the Great Depression kept the Republi@@ c@@ ans from the US presiden@@ cy for 20 year@@ s@@ ).
The Republican leadership is making threats that are not credi@@ ble.
If Barack Obama’s administration pla@@ ys its hand well@@ , the result will be a la@@ st-@@ min@@ ute exten@@ sion of the debt c@@ ei@@ ling with no significant conc@@ ession@@ s.
It is un@@ clear how Bo@@ eh@@ ner or anyone el@@ se would be able to por@@ tra@@ y that as a political vic@@ tor@@ y.
CAMBRIDGE – N@@ ex@@ t year mark@@ s the 50@@ th anni@@ vers@@ ary of the United Stat@@ es@@ -@@ Japan Security Treat@@ y, a central feat@@ ure of stability in East Asia for half a century.
But now, with the Japanese experienc@@ ing a period of domestic political uncertain@@ ty, and North Kore@@ a’s nuclear tests and missi@@ le laun@@ ches increasing their an@@ xi@@ et@@ y, will Japan re@@ verse its long-@@ standing decision not to seek a national nu@@ cle@@ ar-@@ deter@@ r@@ ent cap@@ abilit@@ y?
Is the US-@@ Japan alliance coming to an end@@ ?@@  
In the early 199@@ 0’s, many Americans regar@@ ded Japan as an economic threat@@ .
Some people – in both countries – viewed the security alliance as a Cold War reli@@ c to be dis@@ car@@ ded.
These tren@@ ds were re@@ vers@@ ed by the Clinton administ@@ ration@@ ’s 199@@ 5 “@@ East Asia Strat@@ eg@@ y Re@@ port@@ .”
In 199@@ 6, the Clint@@ on-@@ H@@ as@@ hi@@ mo@@ to Dec@@ lar@@ ation st@@ ated that the US-@@ Japan security alliance was the found@@ ation for stability that would allow growing prosperity in post-@@ Cold War East Asi@@ a.
That approach has continued on a bi@@ parti@@ s@@ an basis in the US, and poll@@ s show that it re@@ tains broad accep@@ t@@ ance in Japan@@ .
Most close obser@@ vers of the relationship agree that the US-@@ Japan alliance is in much better shap@@ e today than 15 years ago.
N@@ on@@ eth@@ eless, the alliance faces three major challenges in a new external environ@@ ment.
One is North Korea, whose recent behavior has been cle@@ ver and dec@@ ep@@ tive.
The North Kore@@ ans have viol@@ ated their agreem@@ ents, know@@ ing that China, the country with the greatest potential lever@@ age, is most concerned about regime collapse in North Korea, and thus the threat of cha@@ os on its bor@@ der@@ s.
Japan offici@@ ally end@@ or@@ ses the objec@@ tive of a non-@@ nuclear world, but it reli@@ es on America’s exten@@ ded nuclear deter@@ r@@ ent, and wants to avoid being subject to nuclear bl@@ ack@@ ma@@ il from North Korea (or Chin@@ a@@ ).
The Japanese fear that the credi@@ bility of American exten@@ ded deter@@ ren@@ ce will be weak@@ ened if the US de@@ creas@@ es its nuclear forces to par@@ ity with Chin@@ a@@ . @@  
It is a mistak@@ e, however, to believe that exten@@ ded deter@@ ren@@ ce depends on par@@ ity in numbers of nuclear weapon@@ s.
R@@ ath@@ er, it depends on a combin@@ ation of cap@@ ability and credi@@ bilit@@ y.
During the Cold W@@ ar, the US was able to def@@ end Ber@@ lin because our promise to do so was made credi@@ ble by the NATO alliance and the presence of American tro@@ op@@ s, whose lives would be on the line in the ev@@ ent of a Soviet attack@@ .
Indeed, the best guarantee of American exten@@ ded deter@@ ren@@ ce over Japan remains the presence of nearly 50@@ ,000 American troops (@@ which Japan help@@ s to maintain with gener@@ ous ho@@ st-@@ nation sup@@ port@@ ).
C@@ redi@@ bility is also enh@@ anced by jo@@ int projects such as the development of regional bal@@ li@@ stic missi@@ le def@@ en@@ se.
E@@ qu@@ ally important are American actions that show the high pri@@ ority that the US gi@@ ves to the alli@@ ance, and its guarante@@ es not to eng@@ age in what Japan fear@@ s will be “@@ Japan@@ -@@ pass@@ ing@@ ” in its relations with Asi@@ a.
That is why it was so important that US Secretary of State H@@ ill@@ ary Clint@@ on’s first tri@@ p was to Asia, and her first stop in Japan@@ .
It is also why it is mistak@@ en to spe@@ ak of a form@@ al G-@@ 2 with China, rather than multilateral cooper@@ ation.
A second challenge for Japan is the dramatic rise of China’s economy. Although an important trade partn@@ er, China’s growing power makes Japan ner@@ vo@@ us.
When re-@@ negoti@@ ating the US-@@ Japan security alliance in the 199@@ 0’s, Japanese leaders sometimes priv@@ ately asked me if the US would des@@ ert Japan in favor of China.
I respon@@ ded then (and toda@@ y@@ ) that there is little prospect of such a re@@ vers@@ al, for two reason@@ s.
First, China poses a potential thre@@ at, whereas Japan does not.
Second, the US shar@@ es democratic values with Japan, and China is not a democracy.
Moreover, China’s internal ev@@ olution remains uncertain@@ .
While Chinese are more free today than at any time in their history, China’s political ev@@ olution has lag@@ ged behind its economic progres@@ s.
Un@@ like India, China has not sol@@ ved the problem of political particip@@ ation.
There is always a res@@ i@@ du@@ al danger that China will em@@ bra@@ ce nation@@ alism to ward off domestic problems.
At the same time, it is in the interest of the US, Japan, and China that China’s rise be peaceful and har@@ mon@@ i@@ ous (@@ in the wor@@ ds of Chinese leader@@ s@@ ).
Tre@@ at China as an enem@@ y, and you guarantee en@@ mit@@ y.
That is why the strategy of integra@@ tion, pl@@ us a h@@ ed@@ ge against uncertain@@ ty, makes sense for both the US and Japan@@ .
Indeed, there are strong ground@@ s for the US, Japan, and China to eng@@ age in areas of tri@@ later@@ al and other regional cooper@@ ation.
Thir@@ d, the US-@@ Japan alliance will have to face a new set of trans@@ national challenges to our vital interest@@ s, such as pan@@ dem@@ ic@@ s, terror@@ ism, and human out@@ flows from failed states.
Ch@@ ief among these challenges is the threat posed by global warm@@ ing, with China having sur@@ pass@@ ed the US as the leading produc@@ er of car@@ b@@ on-@@ di@@ ox@@ ide emissions (@@ though not in per capita term@@ s@@ ).
For@@ tun@@ ately, this is an area that pla@@ ys to Japan’s strength@@ s.
Although some Japanese comp@@ la@@ in about the un@@ equal nature of the alli@@ anc@@ e’s security comp@@ on@@ ents, owing to the limits that Japan has accepted on the use of forc@@ e, in these new are@@ as, Japan is a stronger partn@@ er.
Japan’s over@@ se@@ as development assistance in places ran@@ ging from Africa to Afghanistan, its particip@@ ation in global health projec@@ ts, its support of the United Nation@@ s, its n@@ av@@ al particip@@ ation in anti-@@ pi@@ ra@@ cy oper@@ ations, and its research and development on energy effici@@ ency place it at the for@@ ef@@ ron@@ t in de@@ aling with the new trans@@ national challen@@ ges.
Given today’s agenda@@ , there is enormous potential for an equal partner@@ ship, working with other@@ s, in the provi@@ sion of global public goods that will benefit the US, Japan, and the rest of the world.
That is why I remain optim@@ is@@ tic about the future of the US-@@ Japan alli@@ ance.
The World Bank and IMF have comple@@ ted their annual me@@ et@@ ings, which were gre@@ et@@ ed by stre@@ et demon@@ stra@@ tions and a p@@ au@@ city of innov@@ ative ide@@ as.
H@@ ere George Sor@@ os suggests a b@@ old new t@@ ack to restruc@@ ture the world's financial system.
The international financial system is bro@@ ken down in the sense that it fail@@ s to provide adequate capital to countries that need it most and quali@@ fy for it.
Global financial markets su@@ ck most of the world's savings to the cent@@ er, but they fail to p@@ um@@ p money back out to the peripher@@ y.
Indeed, since 199@@ 7, there has been a re@@ verse f@@ low of capital from countries on the poor peripher@@ y of the world economy to those in the weal@@ thy cent@@ er.
The fac@@ ts spe@@ ak for themsel@@ ves.
America r@@ uns a chron@@ ic current account deficit approach@@ ing an ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing 5% of GDP@@ ; $@@ 2@@ 4@@ 2 billion in the first half of this year.
At the same time, Brazi@@ l - which has followed sound economic policies and has health@@ y budget and trade surpl@@ uses - cannot re@@ finance its debt at accep@@ table rates.
The prev@@ ail@@ ing belief that market discipl@@ ine correc@@ ts such im@@ balances is fal@@ se, for two reason@@ s.
First, financial markets are inher@@ ently un@@ st@@ able.
Second, the international financial system is bi@@ as@@ ed in favor of the weal@@ thy cent@@ er.
In@@ stability ar@@ is@@ es because financial markets try to dis@@ coun@@ t a future that depends on their own behavi@@ or.
It is now recognized that this can lead to what economists call "@@ multi@@ ple equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ a@@ ," but we continue to den@@ y the clear implic@@ ation that financial markets cannot be left to their own de@@ vic@@ es.
In practic@@ e, of course, international financial markets never have been left to their own de@@ vic@@ es.
R@@ ich countries, led by the US, are in char@@ ge.
Their primary task is protec@@ ting their own interest@@ s.
When these countries get into troub@@ le, their authorities interven@@ e forc@@ eful@@ ly.
Coun@@ tries that cannot bor@@ row in international markets in their own currency lack that power.
They must turn to the IMF@@ , and the IMF is more concerned with international financial stability than with enab@@ ling developing countries to pursue the counter@@ cy@@ cli@@ cal policies needed to avoid recession@@ .
Un@@ til rec@@ ently, IMF res@@ c@@ ue programs were designed to enable deb@@ tor countries to meet their oblig@@ ations.
Ta@@ x@@ pay@@ ers in deb@@ tor countries, such as Mexico@@ , pi@@ ck@@ ed up the t@@ ab.
This may have been un@@ fair@@ , but at least it kept money flow@@ ing to the peripher@@ y.
The emerging market crisis of 199@@ 7-@@ 1998 changed all this.
That crisis was at@@ tri@@ but@@ ed not to inst@@ ability in the financial markets and the lo@@ p@@ si@@ de@@ d@@ ness of the system, but to the "@@ moral ha@@ z@@ ard@@ " introduc@@ ed by IMF bail@@ -@@ out@@ s.
This lead to a U@@ -@@ tur@@ n@@ : from bail@@ -@@ ou@@ ts to "@@ bail@@ -@@ ins@@ ," and to private sector burden shar@@ ing.
Mor@@ al ha@@ z@@ ard has been cur@@ tail@@ ed but the risks of invest@@ ing in emerging markets increas@@ ed.
Those risks are now reflec@@ ted in market prices, which is the source of toda@@ y's problem.
What can prevent the situation from deter@@ i@@ or@@ ating further and perhaps cul@@ min@@ ating in a system@@ ic crisi@@ s?
In the bro@@ ad@@ est term@@ s, we must create a more level pla@@ ying fiel@@ d.
There is nothing wrong with im@@ posing market discipl@@ ine on countries that follow un@@ sound policies, but the risk@@ -@@ re@@ ward rati@@ o for lending and invest@@ ing has shif@@ ted too far against the peripher@@ y.
Coun@@ tries that quali@@ fy ought to have access to a l@@ ender of last res@@ ort and be em@@ power@@ ed to pursue counter@@ cy@@ cli@@ cal policies.
Braz@@ il, for example, confron@@ ts an un@@ am@@ big@@ u@@ ous case of market fail@@ u@@ re.
Although the ma@@ xim@@ um sustainable real interest rate is about 10@@ %, Braz@@ il@@ 's doll@@ ar-@@ den@@ omin@@ ated debt yiel@@ ds 2@@ 4@@ .@@ 5@@ %.
A one-@@ year Re@@ al no@@ te pa@@ ys 2@@ 7@@ %.
At these rates, Brazi@@ l is head@@ ing for bankrup@@ t@@ cy.
If no l@@ ender of last res@@ ort ensu@@ res that credit is available at or below 10@@ %, Brazi@@ l cannot be expected to meet its oblig@@ ations - de@@ aling a terri@@ ble b@@ low both to Brazi@@ l and the international financial system.
Wh@@ ere there is a political will, there is a way.
For inst@@ ance, the central banks of the US, Europe, Japan, and Britain could accept Brazi@@ li@@ an pap@@ er at their dis@@ coun@@ t win@@ dow@@ s.
The IMF could guarantee the central banks against market risk at current pric@@ es.
This would provide a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous boost to the market and drasti@@ cally reduce interest rates.
Natur@@ ally, all guarante@@ es would be condi@@ tional on Brazi@@ l ab@@ iding by the IMF agreem@@ ent.
If success@@ ful@@ , the IMF guarantee would never be in@@ vo@@ k@@ ed.
What I pro@@ pose is no@@ vel@@ : it would lever@@ age the IMF@@ 's $@@ 30 billion lo@@ an to Brazi@@ l ten@@ fol@@ d (and set a us@@ eful preced@@ ent@@ ).
Unfortunately, such a schem@@ e exc@@ e@@ eds the imag@@ in@@ ation and political will of the IMF@@ 's sharehol@@ der@@ s.
But let@@ 's be cle@@ ar@@ : failure to address the problem could have disa@@ stro@@ us consequ@@ enc@@ es.
After all, how would a Brazi@@ li@@ an default aff@@ ect Mexico@@ ?
Ad@@ d@@ res@@ sing the bro@@ a@@ der, system@@ -@@ wide proble@@ m, we must find ways to stimul@@ ate dom@@ es@@ tic@@ -@@ led growth in the peripher@@ y countries.
Coun@@ tries that follow sound macroeconomic policies do not deri@@ ve sufficient economic benefits from doing so.
This gener@@ ates political dis@@ con@@ tent that could have ad@@ verse consequences beyond the economic sp@@ her@@ e.
At pres@@ ent, the US ser@@ ves as the mo@@ tor of the global economy.
But a chron@@ ic current account deficit is un@@ so@@ und, un@@ fair@@ , and un@@ sustainable in the long run@@ .
More urg@@ ently, the US mo@@ tor is sp@@ ut@@ ter@@ ing.
It would be benefit all parties to start another mo@@ tor@@ .
To this end, I proposed an annual issue of Sp@@ eci@@ al D@@ ra@@ wing R@@ igh@@ ts (@@ S@@ DR@@ ) that rich countries would don@@ ate for international assi@@ st@@ ance.
This is a proposal whose time has come because the world economy is ho@@ ver@@ ing on the br@@ in@@ k of defl@@ ation.
Un@@ til rec@@ ently, globalization un@@ fol@@ ded against the back@@ ground of a global boom@@ ; now we are experienc@@ ing a global be@@ ar market.
I am af@@ ra@@ id globalization may not survi@@ ve unless we find new ways to stimul@@ ate the global economy.
The S@@ D@@ R don@@ ation schem@@ e would activ@@ ate resources that are currently id@@ le, benef@@ iting don@@ ors and re@@ ci@@ pi@@ ents.
It would also reduce the increasing inequality between rich and poor countries.
K@@ Y@@ I@@ V – Ukra@@ ine@@ ’s parliamentary election on Oc@@ tober 2@@ 8 will be neither free nor fair@@ .
After ei@@ ght un@@ productive years since the 2004 O@@ range Revolu@@ tion, the democratic opposition is de@@ pressed and de@@ mor@@ aliz@@ ed.
Even so, the elections may ch@@ ec@@ k President Vi@@ k@@ tor Y@@ anu@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch@@ ’s power.
Y@@ anu@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch came to power in Febru@@ ary 201@@ 0, in elections that were rated free and fair (and at a time when Fre@@ ed@@ om Hous@@ e still rank@@ ed Ukraine as democrati@@ c@@ ).
But he quickly consolid@@ ated power and turned Ukraine into a mil@@ dly authoritarian state.
A do@@ zen promin@@ ent opposition politicians have been sent@@ enc@@ ed to prison@@ , including former Prime Minister Y@@ uli@@ a T@@ y@@ mo@@ sh@@ enk@@ o and the former inter@@ ior minister, Y@@ ur@@ i L@@ ut@@ sen@@ ko@@ .
T@@ y@@ mo@@ sh@@ en@@ ko@@ , who was and remains the leader of the liberal and pro-@@ Western opposi@@ tion, was sent@@ enc@@ ed to se@@ ven years in pri@@ son for a gas deal with Russia in which she was not even acc@@ used of having benef@@ ited person@@ ally.
Without her@@ , the democratic opposition has no strong leader@@ .
But Y@@ anu@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch has not stopp@@ ed ther@@ e.
He ex@@ er@@ ts heav@@ y pressure on private tel@@ evi@@ sion chan@@ n@@ el@@ s, and has block@@ ed lic@@ ens@@ es and c@@ able access for the independent tel@@ evi@@ sion chan@@ ne@@ l T@@ Vi@@ , which has ex@@ posed the most serious corruption cases of his administ@@ ra@@ tion.
Moreover, he uses the civil service and law@@ -@@ en@@ forc@@ ement authorities exten@@ si@@ vely to repres@@ s the opposition and promote his pro@@ t@@ é@@ g@@ é@@ s.
And yet the up@@ coming election mat@@ ters.
Ukraine has a vi@@ b@@ rant civil society and exc@@ ell@@ ent free Internet medi@@ a.
But the opposi@@ tion, which com@@ pri@@ ses half the country, is b@@ adly de@@ mor@@ alized after five years of stal@@ em@@ ate among the O@@ range Revolu@@ tion@@ ’s leader@@ s, for which the largest share of blam@@ e falls on former President Vi@@ k@@ tor Y@@ ush@@ chen@@ ko@@ , who by almost all accoun@@ ts has betra@@ yed the democratic break@@ through that he represent@@ ed.
He now lead@@ s a party that suppor@@ ts Y@@ anu@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch, who has even allowed Y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enk@@ o to remain in the presidential res@@ i@@ dence since leaving offic@@ e.
Ukra@@ ini@@ an voters are fi@@ ck@@ le.
They voted against the inc@@ um@@ b@@ ent powers in the presidential elections of 199@@ 4, 200@@ 4, and 201@@ 0. They may do so again@@ .
The most recent public-@@ opinion pol@@ l suggest@@ ed that Y@@ anu@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch@@ ’s Party of Regi@@ ons would ob@@ tain 2@@ 8% of the vo@@ te, and that its only ally to sur@@ p@@ ass the 5% electoral th@@ res@@ hold would be the commun@@ ist@@ s, with 1@@ 1@@ %, giving them a total of 3@@ 9@@ %, compared to 3@@ 6% for two opposition parti@@ es, T@@ y@@ mo@@ sh@@ en@@ ko@@ ’s F@@ a@@ ther@@ land party (@@ 19@@ %@@ ) and the heav@@ y@@ wei@@ ght bo@@ x@@ ing ch@@ amp@@ i@@ on V@@ it@@ al@@ i Kli@@ tsch@@ ko@@ ’s U@@ D@@ A@@ R (@@ 17@@ %@@ ).
The pre@@ d@@ atory nature of Y@@ anu@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch@@ ’s rule is not exac@@ tly well h@@ id@@ den@@ ; his family members and loy@@ alists control the entire security appar@@ at@@ us and the main economic agen@@ cies.
He is righ@@ tly scar@@ ed by the democratic opposi@@ tion, which he is em@@ as@@ cul@@ ating by all reason@@ ably soft mean@@ s.
Anti@@ cip@@ ating that his party might lose the up@@ coming election if Ukra@@ ine@@ ’s propor@@ tional vo@@ ting system were maintain@@ ed, Y@@ anu@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch has re@@ ver@@ ted to the electoral system of 200@@ 2, with only half of the 4@@ 50 se@@ ats to be distri@@ but@@ ed propor@@ tion@@ ally.
The rema@@ ining 2@@ 25 se@@ ats will be fill@@ ed in winn@@ er-@@ tak@@ e-@@ all sing@@ le-@@ member constitu@@ en@@ cies – a change that gi@@ ves regional ty@@ co@@ ons a great opportunity to buy se@@ at@@ s.
But Y@@ anu@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch failed to anti@@ cip@@ ate that ty@@ co@@ ons would d@@ are to be dis@@ loy@@ al to him@@ .
Initi@@ ally, his government contain@@ ed n@@ ine groups of big business@@ men, but that number has fallen gradu@@ ally, and even top business@@ men have been margin@@ alized by his core loy@@ ali@@ sts, who are widely ru@@ mor@@ ed to be en@@ rich@@ ing themselves at the exp@@ ense of both the state and private bus@@ ines@@ s.
Un@@ like Russian President Vladimir Put@@ in, Y@@ anu@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch seems to have ste@@ am@@ ro@@ ll@@ ed too many too fa@@ st, over@@ estim@@ ating his power and nar@@ row@@ ing his bas@@ e.
Indeed, he appears to have turned all of Ukra@@ ine@@ ’s top oli@@ g@@ arch@@ s into his enem@@ i@@ es.
E@@ ach su@@ mm@@ er, the promin@@ ent Ukra@@ ini@@ an business@@ man V@@ ic@@ tor P@@ in@@ ch@@ u@@ k organiz@@ es a major international con@@ fer@@ ence, the Y@@ al@@ ta European Strat@@ eg@@ y, atten@@ ded by the Ukra@@ ini@@ an eli@@ te and promin@@ ent for@@ eig@@ ner@@ s.
This Septem@@ ber, the lesson of the con@@ ference was that Y@@ anu@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch has isol@@ ated himself not only from the West and Russia, but also from his main back@@ ers at hom@@ e.
The Ukra@@ ini@@ an ty@@ co@@ ons are no fo@@ ol@@ s.
They view the up@@ coming election as their last chance to stand up against Y@@ anu@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch.
The many parliament@@ ari@@ ans to be elected in sing@@ le-@@ member constitu@@ en@@ cies are more likely to o@@ be@@ y them than Y@@ anu@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch.
Un@@ der the electoral system in place in 200@@ 2, the ruling party quickly di@@ sin@@ teg@@ rated into n@@ ine oli@@ g@@ arch@@ ic party fac@@ tions.
Som@@ ething similar is likely to happen this time aro@@ und@@ .
The ty@@ co@@ ons might not o@@ ust Y@@ anu@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch, but they will ch@@ ec@@ k his power.
Their most vo@@ cal public represent@@ atives are Fir@@ st Dep@@ ut@@ y Prime Minister V@@ al@@ eri@@ y K@@ hor@@ o@@ sh@@ ko@@ v@@ sk@@ i@@ y and the economy minister, P@@ et@@ ro Por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko@@ , who was a major force behind the O@@ range Revolu@@ tion.
The business@@ men@@ ’s main objec@@ tion to Y@@ anu@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch is that he pre@@ f@@ ers to keep T@@ y@@ mo@@ sh@@ enk@@ o in pri@@ son rather than ob@@ tain an As@@ soci@@ ation A@@ gre@@ ement with the European Union.
The al@@ read@@ y-@@ conclu@@ ded fre@@ e-@@ trade agreement with the EU would offer Ukraine b@@ adly needed market access and increased export@@ s, but the EU will not rati@@ fy it unless T@@ y@@ mo@@ sh@@ enk@@ o is re@@ leas@@ ed and repres@@ sion of the opposition and media c@@ eas@@ es.
Similarly, the ty@@ co@@ ons advoc@@ ate restor@@ ed cooperation with the International Monetary Fund@@ , because they want access to credit at reason@@ able interest rates.
But Y@@ anu@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch ref@@ uses to liber@@ alize gas prices, a key IMF dem@@ and.
Con@@ c@@ ern that the West@@ ’s pro-@@ reform stance will push Ukraine into Russia’s em@@ bra@@ ce is largely un@@ fo@@ un@@ ded.
Y@@ anu@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch@@ ’s personal relations with Putin are so poor that Putin all but ref@@ uses to talk to him – other than to make pre@@ po@@ ster@@ ous dem@@ and@@ s.
The West thus has an important role to play in the elec@@ tion, and is providing two thous@@ and election monit@@ ors to help to ensure a free and fair vo@@ te.
Indeed, the United States and the EU, in particul@@ ar, have a large st@@ ake in the out@@ come.
Ukraine is a friend@@ ly country – one that always jo@@ ins Western “@@ co@@ ali@@ tions of the willing@@ .”
But it is a l@@ ap@@ sed democratic country.
They must help to change th@@ at.
September 1@@ 1, 2001, is one of those d@@ ates that mark a transform@@ ation in world politics.
J@@ ust as the fall of the Ber@@ lin Wall on November 9, 198@@ 9, signi@@ fied the Cold War@@ ’s end, al-@@ Qaed@@ a’s attack on the United States op@@ ened a new e@@ po@@ ch.
A non-@@ government@@ al group killed more Americans that day than the government of Japan did with its surpri@@ se attack on another transform@@ ative d@@ ate, Dec@@ ember 7, 194@@ 1.
While the ji@@ ha@@ di terrorist movement had been growing for a deca@@ de, 9@@ /@@ 11 was the tur@@ ning poin@@ t.
Fi@@ ve years into this new er@@ a, how should we charac@@ teri@@ ze it@@ ?
Some believe that 9@@ /@@ 11 us@@ her@@ ed in a “@@ cl@@ ash of civili@@ z@@ ations@@ ” between Islam v@@ s. the Wes@@ t.
Indeed, that is probably what O@@ sam@@ a bin La@@ den had in min@@ d.
Terror@@ ism is a form of the@@ at@@ er.
Extre@@ m@@ ists k@@ ill in@@ no@@ cent people in order to dramati@@ ze their message in a way that shock@@ s and hor@@ ri@@ fi@@ es their inten@@ ded au@@ di@@ ence.
They also rely on what C@@ lar@@ k Mc@@ C@@ au@@ le@@ y and others have called “@@ ju@@ j@@ it@@ s@@ u politic@@ s@@ ,” in which a smaller figh@@ ter uses the streng@@ th of the larger oppon@@ ent to defe@@ at him@@ .
In that sen@@ se, bin La@@ den hop@@ ed that the US would be lu@@ red into a blo@@ od@@ y war in Afghanistan, similar to the Soviet intervention two decades ear@@ li@@ er, which had created such a fer@@ ti@@ le rec@@ ru@@ iting ground for ji@@ ha@@ dist@@ s.
But the Americans used a mo@@ dest amount of force to re@@ move the Taliban government, avo@@ ided dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ate civilian cas@@ u@@ al@@ ties, and were able to create an indi@@ gen@@ ous political frame@@ work.
While far from perf@@ ec@@ t, the first round in the fight went to the US.
Al-@@ Qaed@@ a lost the sanc@@ tu@@ aries from which it plann@@ ed its attack@@ s; many of its leaders were killed or cap@@ tu@@ re@@ d@@ ; and its central communic@@ ations were sever@@ ely dis@@ rup@@ ted.
Th@@ en the Bush administration succ@@ um@@ bed to h@@ ub@@ ri@@ s and made the c@@ olo@@ ss@@ al mist@@ ake of inv@@ ad@@ ing Iraq without broad international suppor@@ t.
Iraq provided the sym@@ bol@@ s, civilian cas@@ u@@ al@@ ties, and rec@@ ru@@ iting ground that the ji@@ ha@@ di extrem@@ ists had sought in Afghanist@@ an.
Iraq was George Bush’s gi@@ ft to O@@ sam@@ a bin L@@ ad@@ en.
Al-@@ Qaed@@ a lost its central organiz@@ ational capac@@ ity, but it became a symbo@@ l and fo@@ cal point around which lik@@ e-@@ min@@ ded im@@ it@@ ators could r@@ ally.
With the help of the Inter@@ net, its sym@@ bol@@ s and tra@@ ining materi@@ als became easily available around the world.
W@@ he@@ ther al-@@ Qaed@@ a had a direct role in the Mad@@ ri@@ d and London bom@@ b@@ ings, or the recent p@@ lot to b@@ low up air@@ lin@@ ers over the Atlan@@ tic@@ , is less important than the way it has been transform@@ ed into a powerful “@@ br@@ and@@ .”
The second round went to the extre@@ mist@@ s.
The outcome of future round@@ s in the struggle against ji@@ ha@@ di terrorism will depend on our ability to avoid the tra@@ p of “@@ ju@@ j@@ it@@ s@@ u politic@@ s.”
That will require more use of the soft power of attrac@@ tion rather than rel@@ ying so heav@@ ily on hard military power, as the Bush administration has don@@ e.
For the struggle is not a cl@@ ash of Islam v@@ s. the Wes@@ t, but a civil war within Islam between a min@@ ority of terror@@ ists and a larger main@@ stre@@ am of non-@@ violent belie@@ ver@@ s.
Ji@@ ha@@ di extre@@ mis@@ m cannot be defe@@ ated unless the main@@ stre@@ am win@@ s.
Milit@@ ary forc@@ e, intel@@ li@@ gen@@ ce, and international police cooperation needs to be used against har@@ d@@ core terror@@ ists aff@@ ili@@ ated with or inspi@@ red by al-@@ Qaed@@ a, but soft power is essential to attrac@@ ting the main@@ stre@@ am and dr@@ ying up support for the extre@@ mist@@ s.
US Secretary of Def@@ ense D@@ onald R@@ ums@@ feld once said that the measure of success in this war is whether the number of terror@@ ists we are kill@@ ing and deter@@ ring is larger than the number that the terror@@ ists are rec@@ ru@@ it@@ ing.
By this stand@@ ar@@ d, we are doing b@@ ad@@ ly.
In November 200@@ 3, the official number of terrorist insur@@ g@@ ents in Iraq was given as 5@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0.
This year, it was repor@@ ted to be 20@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0.
As Bri@@ g. General Robert C@@ as@@ l@@ en, the P@@ ent@@ ag@@ on’s dep@@ ut@@ y direc@@ tor for the war on terror@@ ism, put it, “@@ We are not kill@@ ing them faster than they are being cre@@ at@@ ed@@ .”
We are also fail@@ ing in the app@@ lic@@ ation of soft power.
According to C@@ as@@ l@@ en, “@@ We in the P@@ ent@@ ag@@ on are behind our ad@@ vers@@ aries in the use of communic@@ ation – either to rec@@ ru@@ it or tra@@ in@@ .”
The man@@ ner in which we use military power also affec@@ ts R@@ ums@@ fel@@ d@@ ’s rati@@ o.
In the after@@ mat@@ h of 9@@ /@@ 1@@ 1, there was a good deal of symp@@ ath@@ y and understanding around the world for America’s military response against the Tali@@ b@@ an.
The US inv@@ asion of Iraq, a country that was not connec@@ ted to the 9@@ /@@ 11 attack@@ s, squ@@ ander@@ ed that good will, and the attrac@@ tiveness of the US in Muslim countries like Indonesi@@ a pl@@ um@@ met@@ ed from 7@@ 5% appro@@ val in 2000 to half that level today.
Indeed, occup@@ ying a divi@@ ded nation is mess@@ y, and it is bound to produce ep@@ is@@ o@@ des like Ab@@ u G@@ h@@ ra@@ i@@ b and Ha@@ di@@ th@@ a, which under@@ cut America’s attrac@@ tiveness not just in Iraq, but around the world.
The ability to comb@@ ine hard and soft power is sm@@ art power.
When the Soviet Union inv@@ aded Hung@@ ary and C@@ z@@ ech@@ os@@ lo@@ v@@ ak@@ ia during the Cold W@@ ar, it under@@ cut the soft power that it had enjo@@ yed in Europe in the after@@ mat@@ h of World War II@@ .
When Israel laun@@ ched a l@@ eng@@ thy bom@@ bing campaign in Leban@@ on last mon@@ th, it created so many civilian cas@@ u@@ al@@ ties that the early critic@@ is@@ ms of Hez@@ bollah by Egyp@@ t, Jord@@ an, and Saudi Arabi@@ a became un@@ ten@@ able in Arab politics.
When terrorist exc@@ esses killed in@@ no@@ cent Muslim civili@@ ans such as Egypti@@ an Islamic Ji@@ had did in 199@@ 3 or Ab@@ u Mus@@ ab al-@@ Z@@ ar@@ q@@ aw@@ i did in Am@@ man in 200@@ 5, they under@@ cut their own soft power and lost suppor@@ t.
The most important lesson five years after 9@@ /@@ 11 is that failure to comb@@ ine hard and soft power effectively in the struggle against ji@@ ha@@ di terrorism will lead us into the tra@@ p set by those who want a cl@@ ash of civili@@ z@@ ations.
Muslim@@ s, including Islam@@ ist@@ s, have a diversi@@ ty of view@@ s, so we need to be war@@ y of strategi@@ es that help our enem@@ ies by un@@ iting di@@ spar@@ ate forces behind one b@@ ann@@ er.
We have a just cause and many potential alli@@ es, but our failure to comb@@ ine hard and soft power into a sm@@ art strategy could be f@@ at@@ al.
CAMBRIDG@@ E@@ : Despite NA@@ S@@ D@@ A@@ Q cra@@ sh@@ es and the threat of US recession@@ , the New Econom@@ y is here to sta@@ y.
Indeed, it remains the key to improved performance in Europe and Japan in the years ahe@@ ad.
But wher@@ e, exac@@ t@@ ly, does the heart of the New economy lie@@ ?
Is it in more competitive labor markets or in better tax systems or in der@@ eg@@ ul@@ ation@@ ?
Cor@@ por@@ ate govern@@ ance, too, is a mo@@ tor of the New Econom@@ y that should not be under@@ rat@@ ed.
If manag@@ ers create produc@@ tive, flexi@@ ble structu@@ res focused on wealth cre@@ ation, companies find it easy to ad@@ just and ex@@ pl@@ or@@ e new sources of productivity and cost contro@@ l.
If de@@ cent@@ rali@@ zation and risk taking are part of a comp@@ an@@ y’s mission@@ , innov@@ ation in products and proc@@ esses is certain to take plac@@ e.
I@@ f, on the contrary, bo@@ s@@ ses be@@ have like cau@@ tious ex@@ ec@@ ut@@ ors of a weal@@ thy est@@ ate, their companies will soon look like mus@@ e@@ um@@ s.
A country’s economic performan@@ ce, indeed, is a mir@@ ror ima@@ ge of its res@@ ident compani@@ es.
Coun@@ tries with great companies show great performan@@ ce.
Wh@@ ere then are the great companies of the world to be found@@ ?
No surpri@@ se that more than half of the most respec@@ ted companies are Americ@@ an.
Although Europe is roughly the same economic size as the US, it has far fe@@ wer winn@@ ing corporate te@@ am@@ s.
Japan may be much smaller than America or Europe, but it under@@ per@@ forms its share of G@@ 7 income or weal@@ th.
The p@@ ic@@ ture could not be cle@@ ar@@ er@@ : the US economy per@@ forms st@@ un@@ n@@ ing@@ ly, as does its corporate sector@@ ; Europe is far behin@@ d@@ ; and Japan does not really regi@@ st@@ er.
Pe@@ ering into the future of this pre@@ mi@@ er le@@ ague of companies five years from now, the F@@ T se@@ es a number of shif@@ ts as lik@@ el@@ y, with Europe cat@@ ching up@@ , Japan los@@ ing even more ground@@ , and America giving up some ground@@ , to@@ o.
This g@@ li@@ mp@@ se into the future mir@@ ror@@ s today’s perc@@ ep@@ tions of a mat@@ uring (@@ a co@@ de-@@ wor@@ d for los@@ ing its ed@@ ge@@ ) American economy and a Europe able to play cat@@ ch@@ -@@ up because the new business culture is at last taking hol@@ d.
This surv@@ ey also ac@@ cur@@ ately reflects the reality that very few Japanese firms are succe@@ ed@@ ing at the hard task of restruc@@ tur@@ ing, of shif@@ ting to moder@@ n, world@@ -@@ class govern@@ ance.
Wor@@ l@@ d-@@ class Son@@ y sta@@ ys ahe@@ ad@@ ; N@@ T@@ T ( its Do@@ com@@ o subsi@@ di@@ ary is the key her@@ e) hol@@ ds on, but old and ti@@ red H@@ on@@ da and M@@ ats@@ ush@@ it@@ a are likely to be re@@ leg@@ ated to second class stat@@ us.
The dynam@@ ics of the next 5 years will also reflect a head@@ -@@ on competition between winn@@ ing corpor@@ ations.
Bo@@ eing versu@@ s A@@ ir@@ b@@ us may be the most interest@@ ing examp@@ le.
In the current rank@@ ings, both are lock@@ ed in a cl@@ in@@ ch close to the bo@@ tto@@ m of the F@@ T list of top firm@@ s.
In 5 years, however, A@@ ir@@ b@@ us will likely be up and Bo@@ eing out of the ch@@ amp@@ i@@ ons le@@ ague al@@ toge@@ ther.
Wh@@ y?
A@@ ir@@ b@@ us has look@@ ed ahe@@ ad, inves@@ ted, and is bringing on a new J@@ um@@ b@@ o j@@ et that will make Bo@@ ein@@ g@@ ’s existing products look out@@ d@@ ated and in@@ effici@@ ent.
For Bo@@ eing became com@@ plac@@ ent and for@@ go@@ t that the air@@ line business is a cut@@ -@@ th@@ ro@@ at world.
When thinking about economic poten@@ ti@@ al, we tend to look at the quality of the labor forc@@ e, a peop@@ le’s willingness to work, and the level of educ@@ ation.
Se@@ en from this per@@ spec@@ tive, Europe and Japan should tro@@ un@@ ce the US because of their far sup@@ eri@@ or basic education system@@ s, and Japanese discipl@@ ine make Europeans look la@@ z@@ y.
In fact, effort and education are not what matters mo@@ st.
F@@ ar more significant is the economic environment in which people work – a market economy versu@@ s some form of soci@@ alism – and the organiz@@ ation of busin@@ esses in which they particip@@ ate.
The best model of corporate governance to produce strong and la@@ sting economic performance remains to be found@@ .
In the 198@@ 0@@ s, respect for the long-@@ run view of the Japanese model ra@@ n high@@ .
This is no longer so because of Japan’s economic mal@@ a@@ is@@ e.
Th@@ en there was the f@@ li@@ r@@ tation with the German model of business@@ -@@ banking integra@@ tion, which br@@ ings capital markets in-@@ hous@@ e.
That lost its attrac@@ tion when it became clear that co@@ z@@ y relations between bank@@ ers and bo@@ s@@ ses result in toler@@ ance for poor rates of return on capit@@ al.
Now the US model is in@@ : de@@ cent@@ rali@@ z@@ ed, le@@ an on middle manage@@ ment, t@@ ough on the CE@@ O@@ ; and with a “@@ don’t take no for an answer@@ ” co@@ de.
But this won@@ ’t be the last answer@@ , although for the time being it will drive corporate restruc@@ turing and the manag@@ eri@@ al min@@ d.
All this beg@@ s the question as to whether it makes sense to change corporate cultu@@ res every 10 or 20 years.
The pragmati@@ c answer is that it takes very different model@@ s to hand@@ le a stable and st@@ ation@@ ary world as op@@ posed to a world in which der@@ eg@@ ulation and technology produce dramatic change da@@ il@@ y.
The US model works in times of ra@@ pi@@ d, per@@ v@@ asi@@ ve change.
This is what lies ahead for the for@@ es@@ ee@@ able future.
H@@ old on ti@@ gh@@ t.
On both sides of the Atlan@@ tic@@ , many view economic globalization as a threat to bel@@ ow@@ -@@ average ear@@ ner@@ s.
According to a recent pol@@ l by the German Mar@@ sh@@ all Fund@@ , maj@@ ori@@ ties in France, Germany, and the United States favor maintain@@ ing existing trade barri@@ ers, even if doing so ham@@ per@@ s economic growth.
C@@ lear@@ ly, the large net gains from global economic integration are not enough to con@@ vin@@ ce those who have lost their jobs and the many others who feel at risk@@ . 
The recently established European Glob@@ alization Ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ment Fund (@@ E@@ G@@ F@@ ) is an EU-@@ wide response to this challen@@ ge.
The E@@ G@@ F can spend up to €@@ 500 million annu@@ ally in EU member states on workers affec@@ ted by tra@@ de-@@ in@@ duc@@ ed la@@ y@@ off@@ s.
But shar@@ ing the benefits of globalization with the lo@@ ser@@ s is tradition@@ ally regar@@ ded as a national responsi@@ bilit@@ y.
For example, the inspi@@ ration for the E@@ G@@ F@@ , America’s Trade Ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ment As@@ si@@ st@@ ance, introduc@@ ed by the Kenn@@ ed@@ y administration in 196@@ 2, is a pu@@ rely national schem@@ e.
Is EU invol@@ vement really justi@@ fi@@ ed@@ ? 
The economic case for a European globalization f@@ und is that trade policy has been del@@ eg@@ ated to the European level@@ , while Union members re@@ tain control rights to blo@@ ck decision@@ s.
Consider the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical example of full trade liber@@ alization in tex@@ ti@@ l@@ es, which would have great@@ ly asy@@ mmet@@ ri@@ c effects bet@@ we@@ en, say, S@@ w@@ ed@@ en, with hardly any tex@@ ti@@ le indust@@ ry, and Portug@@ al, with a substantial one.
S@@ we@@ den would be a clear ben@@ e@@ fici@@ ary while Portug@@ al would be hit har@@ d, owing to the large number of disp@@ l@@ ac@@ ed tex@@ ti@@ le work@@ ers. 
The negative impact of such re@@ d@@ und@@ an@@ cies is seri@@ ous.
OEC@@ D statisti@@ cs show that 40% to 50% of disp@@ l@@ ac@@ ed manufacturing workers in the EU@@ 15 remain without a job 2@@ 4 months after becoming unemploy@@ ed.
A@@ round 3@@ 0% work in a job that pa@@ ys less than the previous one.
Only around one-@@ quar@@ ter are re-@@ employ@@ ed with a wage at or above the previous level (@@ see char@@ t@@ ). 
Man@@ u@@ fac@@ turing Wor@@ k@@ ers 2@@ 4 Mon@@ th@@ s after La@@ y@@ off in the EU@@ 15

Th@@ rou@@ gh the E@@ G@@ F@@ , part of the cost of helping disp@@ l@@ ac@@ ed tex@@ ti@@ le workers would be bor@@ ne by all EU countries, thereby making wider trade liber@@ alization a more likely prospec@@ t.
Although S@@ w@@ ed@@ en, for example, would be a net contribut@@ or to the E@@ G@@ F@@ , it might well be a net ben@@ e@@ fici@@ ary of the arran@@ gement as a whol@@ e.
In princip@@ le, a we@@ b of bilateral trans@@ fer arran@@ gements could achieve such an un@@ block@@ ing of tra@@ de.
In practic@@ e, however, such trans@@ f@@ ers hardly ever take plac@@ e, so the potential gains from opening trade may fail to materi@@ aliz@@ e. 
Nevertheless, the E@@ G@@ F@@ ’s rules need to be ti@@ ghten@@ ed, l@@ est the schem@@ e comes to be regar@@ ded as a political gi@@ mm@@ i@@ ck@@ .
The current set@@ up lea@@ ves too much ro@@ om for dis@@ cre@@ tion, as neither necessary nor sufficient conditions for aid are clearly sp@@ ell@@ ed out.
This will ex@@ pose the E@@ G@@ F to wa@@ st@@ eful political post@@ uring and lob@@ b@@ ying by countries and sector@@ s.
The E@@ G@@ F@@ ’s rules should be am@@ ended to ensure that governments and tra@@ de-@@ disp@@ l@@ ac@@ ed workers receive transpar@@ ent, visi@@ ble, and reli@@ able assi@@ st@@ ance, as well as to spread best practi@@ ce in active labor market policy. 
Dis@@ placed workers often face unemploy@@ ment, a lower@@ -@@ pa@@ ying job@@ , or a new job far from hom@@ e. Of th@@ es@@ e, the unemploy@@ ed typ@@ ically receive most public suppor@@ t.
To address this di@@ stor@@ tion head on, and to provide cl@@ arity concern@@ ing the alloc@@ ation of fund@@ s, the E@@ G@@ F should focus its limited funds on two simple active labor market program@@ s: wage insurance and mo@@ bility allow@@ ance. 
W@@ age insurance could offer workers whose pay was cut after disp@@ l@@ ac@@ ement compens@@ ation for up to two years amoun@@ ting to half the difference between the old and the new wa@@ ge.
The mo@@ bility allow@@ ance could offer those moving for a new job a l@@ ump@@ -@@ sum pay@@ ment of two month@@ s’ gro@@ s@@ s pay in the previous job@@ , or four month@@ s’ pay for cros@@ s-@@ border mo@@ ves.
The very simp@@ lic@@ ity of this schem@@ e will likely ensure high visi@@ bility and reason@@ able tak@@ e-@@ up rates. 
The down@@ side of such a focused approach is also cle@@ ar@@ : the marg@@ in of choice for EU members about how E@@ G@@ F funds are to be spent in their country would be minim@@ al.
In view of the likely adv@@ ant@@ ag@@ es, this might be accep@@ table if member states could be assu@@ red that, if the schem@@ es work, it will be expan@@ ded.
This can be done as part of a reform of the European Social Fund@@ , which has an annual budget of around €@@ 10 billion – twent@@ y times the current funding of the E@@ G@@ F@@ . 
If the E@@ G@@ F does not prove effec@@ tive, the money can simply be given back to the EU budget or to member states.
But if the E@@ G@@ F does work, the benefits would far out@@ wei@@ gh the cost@@ s. 
NEW HA@@ V@@ E@@ N – On April 2, the G-20 will hold a summit in London to disc@@ uss what we may hope will be an internation@@ ally coordin@@ ated plan to address the world economic crisis.
But can such a plan really work@@ ?
The basic proble@@ m, of course, is confi@@ dence.
People every@@ wher@@ e, consum@@ ers and investors ali@@ k@@ e, are canc@@ el@@ ing spending plan@@ s, because the world economy seems very risk@@ y right now.
The same thing happened during the Great Depression of the 193@@ 0’s.
A con@@ temporary obser@@ ver, Win@@ th@@ ro@@ p C@@ as@@ e, expla@@ ined it all in 193@@ 8@@ : economic revi@@ val depen@@ ded “@@ on the willingness of individual and corporate bu@@ y@@ ers to make purchas@@ es that necess@@ arily ti@@ e up their resources for a consider@@ able l@@ eng@@ th of time.
For the individu@@ al, this implies confidence in the job@@ , and in the end comes equally back to the confidence of industry leader@@ s.” Unfortunately, confidence did not return until World War II ended the de@@ pres@@ sion.
If the leaders meeting in London are to succe@@ ed where governments failed in the 193@@ 0’s, they must com@@ mit themselves to a fiscal target that is sufficient to restore full employment under normal credit condi@@ tions.
They must also com@@ mit themselves to a credit target that will restore lending to norm@@ al.
People will not spend norm@@ ally unless they have both a job and normal access to credi@@ t.
During the Great Depres@@ sion, such targe@@ ts were not used on a large enough sc@@ al@@ e, merely fuel@@ ing public des@@ pa@@ ir that stimulus policies would ever work.
The G-20 Sum@@ mit should also be an occ@@ asion for aff@@ ir@@ m@@ ing some basic principl@@ es.
Con@@ fi@@ dence is@@ n’t built up on the basis of spending or lending al@@ one.
People need to believe that the money repres@@ ents something more la@@ sting than stimulus meas@@ ures, which may eventually end in fail@@ u@@ re.
After all, the Great Depression did not end simply because of the massive stimulus of war@@ -@@ related expendi@@ tur@@ es.
Why should World War II have produced any confidence in the futu@@ re@@ ?
To be sure, World War II reduced the unemployment rate in the United States dramati@@ call@@ y, from 1@@ 5% in 194@@ 0 to 1% in 194@@ 4, and had a similar effect in other countries.
But this was not because of a revi@@ val in business confi@@ dence. It was because of a n@@ ast@@ y war, pla@@ in and simp@@ le, with people dra@@ f@@ ted into figh@@ t@@ ing, or into industri@@ es sup@@ pl@@ ying the war effor@@ t.
The real recovery of confidence did not occ@@ ur until after World War II@@ , when the world did not sin@@ k back into de@@ pres@@ sion.
The US Council of Economic Ad@@ vis@@ ors war@@ ned of this possibility in 194@@ 9, and it was not al@@ one.
There appears to be more than one reason wh@@ y, on the contrary, confidence came ro@@ aring back@@ .
First, there was a general perc@@ ep@@ tion of “@@ p@@ ent-@@ up dem@@ and@@ .”
After years of priv@@ ation (and in many countries the physi@@ cal destruc@@ tion of war@@ ), people just wanted to live norm@@ ally – to re@@ buil@@ d, own a hom@@ e, a car@@ , and other consumer good@@ s.
The widespread im@@ pression that there was such p@@ ent-@@ up demand also led people to believe that there could not be another de@@ pres@@ sion.
The perc@@ ep@@ tion of p@@ ent-@@ up demand was like a powerful economic stimulus pack@@ age, and it had the advantage that people believed it would be long-@@ la@@ st@@ ing.
Indeed, the same long-term confidence trig@@ ger@@ ed the post-@@ war “@@ bab@@ y boom@@ .”
According to some con@@ temporary obser@@ ver@@ s, however, “@@ p@@ ent-@@ up dem@@ and@@ ” was only part of the stor@@ y.
During the bri@@ ef but deep recession of 194@@ 9, the financial com@@ ment@@ ator S@@ il@@ via Por@@ ter reflec@@ ted on the attitu@@ des that led to the 19@@ 2@@ 9 cra@@ sh@@ : “@@ We saw nothing wrong – in fact, we saw everything right – with the wi@@ ld specul@@ ative boom and credit inflation th@@ at@@ …@@ cul@@ min@@ ated in the now almost un@@ believ@@ able gam@@ bl@@ ing org@@ y of 19@@ 2@@ 9@@ .”
But now, Por@@ ter w@@ ro@@ te, after the de@@ pression and war, “@@ We began to li@@ sten to the idea that a hund@@ red million citiz@@ ens, ac@@ ting through a central government, could achieve much more than a hund@@ red million ac@@ ting as separ@@ ate sel@@ fis@@ h un@@ its.
We develop@@ ed, in shor@@ t, a new attitu@@ de toward the responsi@@ bili@@ ties of government@@ .” S@@ he conclu@@ ded that the positive effect of “@@ p@@ ent-@@ up dem@@ and@@ ” and government measures can “@@ make sense only when viewed against the back@@ ground of our changed economic and political philosop@@ hy@@ .”
The Mar@@ sh@@ all Plan@@ , which oper@@ ated from 194@@ 7 to 195@@ 1, became a symbo@@ l of this new attitu@@ de.
The US gave billi@@ ons of dollars of aid to re@@ build war@@ -@@ ra@@ v@@ aged countries in Europe.
The plan was widely viewed as reflec@@ ting a new kind of en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment, a recogni@@ tion of the importance of suppor@@ ting people who needed help@@ .
Europe would not be allowed to langu@@ ish@@ , and the stimulus came from ab@@ road@@ .
After the war, Keyn@@ esi@@ an economic the@@ or@@ y, which was generally not accepted or under@@ stood during the Great Depres@@ sion, became the basis of a new social comp@@ ac@@ t.
It was a theory that was perf@@ ec@@ tly su@@ ited to a generation that had just en@@ du@@ red excep@@ tional sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es, for it re@@ aff@@ ir@@ m@@ ed a belief in our responsibility for each other.
The effect of economic stimulus is re@@ doub@@ led by this kind of inspi@@ rational beli@@ ef@@ .
That is why all of the commit@@ ments made and inten@@ tions ex@@ pressed at the up@@ coming G-20 summit mat@@ ter.
The countries repres@@ ented must show a gener@@ ous spiri@@ t and make the world economy work for all people.
Se@@ em@@ ingly peripher@@ al issu@@ es, like aid to the developing world and the po@@ or, who suff@@ er the most from a crisis like this one, will be part of the primary story of the renew@@ al of confi@@ den@@ ce, just as the Mar@@ sh@@ all Plan was part of that story after World War II@@ .
C@@ HI@@ CA@@ G@@ O – If any solution to the European crisis proposed over the next few days is to restore confidence to the sovereign@@ -@@ bond markets, it will have to be both economic@@ ally vi@@ able and politically pal@@ at@@ able to res@@ cu@@ ers and res@@ cu@@ ed ali@@ k@@ e.
This means pa@@ ying attention not just to the plan@@ ’s techni@@ cal de@@ tail@@ s, but also to appear@@ anc@@ es.
There is growing consensus about any solu@@ tion@@ ’s key el@@ em@@ ents.
First, Italy and Spain will have to come up with credi@@ ble medi@@ um@@ -@@ term plans that will not just restore their fiscal heal@@ th, but also improve their ability to grow their way out of troub@@ le.
While any plan will invol@@ ve pa@@ in for citiz@@ ens, the markets must de@@ em the pa@@ in politically toler@@ able, at least relative to the altern@@ ativ@@ es.
It is important that these plans be seen as dom@@ es@@ tic@@ ally de@@ vis@@ ed (@@ though voters will have no illu@@ sions about the external and market pressu@@ res that have forced their governments to ac@@ t@@ ).
At the same time, an external agen@@ cy such as the International Monetary Fund could ren@@ der the plan more credi@@ ble by ev@@ al@@ u@@ ating it for consist@@ ency with the country’s go@@ als and monit@@ or@@ ing its implement@@ ation.
Second, some v@@ eh@@ ic@@ le – the IMF or the European Financial Stability Fac@@ ilit@@ y, with either enti@@ ty f@@ unded directly by countries or the European Central Bank – has to stand ready to f@@ und borrowing by Ital@@ y, Spain@@ , and any other potentially dist@@ res@@ sed countries over the next year or two@@ .
But there is an important c@@ a@@ ve@@ at, which has largely been ignor@@ ed in public discus@@ sion@@ s: if this funding is senior to private debt (@@ as IMF funding typ@@ ically is@@ ), it will be har@@ der for these countries to re@@ gain access to markets.
After all, the more a country bor@@ ro@@ ws in the short term from official sourc@@ es, the further back in line it push@@ es private credi@@ tor@@ s.
That makes private len@@ ders sus@@ c@@ ep@@ ti@@ ble to larger ha@@ ir@@ cuts if the country eventually defaul@@ ts – and thus more h@@ es@@ it@@ ant to l@@ end in the first plac@@ e.
In other words, private markets need to be convinc@@ ed both that there is a low prob@@ ability of default (@@ h@@ ence the importance of credi@@ ble plan@@ s@@ ), and that there is some additional los@@ s-@@ be@@ aring capacity in the new fund@@ ing, so that, if there is a defaul@@ t, out@@ standing or ro@@ l@@ led@@ -@@ over private debt does not have to be@@ ar the full br@@ un@@ t.
This may seem un@@ fair@@ .
Why should the taxpay@@ er accept a loss when they are bail@@ ing out the private sector by providing new fund@@ ing@@ ?
In an ide@@ al world, dist@@ res@@ sed countries would default as soon as private markets stopp@@ ed funding them, and they would impose the losses on private bond@@ hol@@ der@@ s.
In the real world, however, if Italy and Spain are viewed as being solv@@ ent, or too big to fail@@ , official funding should be structu@@ red so that it gi@@ ves these countries their best chance to re@@ gain market confi@@ dence.
This does not mean that official funding should be j@@ uni@@ or to private debt in any restruc@@ tur@@ ing, for that would require substanti@@ ally more los@@ s-@@ be@@ aring capacity from the official sector – capacity that is probably not avail@@ able.
Indeed, if official funding were j@@ uni@@ or, it would be providing a larger c@@ us@@ hi@@ on to private credi@@ tors – and thus bail@@ ing them out to an even greater ex@@ t@@ ent.
The si@@ m@@ pl@@ est solution is to tre@@ at official funding no differ@@ ently from private debt – best achieved if official len@@ ders buy sovereign bonds as they are issu@@ ed (@@ possibly at a pre@@ determined yiel@@ d@@ ) and agree to be tre@@ ated on p@@ ar with private credi@@ tors in a restruc@@ tur@@ ing.
As the country reg@@ ain@@ s market confi@@ den@@ ce, the official funding can be reduc@@ ed, and eventually the bonds can be sol@@ d back to the markets.
The bo@@ tto@@ m line is that official funding must be ac@@ compani@@ ed by los@@ s-@@ be@@ aring capac@@ ity.
If the funding is chan@@ n@@ el@@ ed through the IMF@@ , and is to be tre@@ ated on p@@ ar with private debt, the Fund will need a guarantee from the E@@ FS@@ F or strong eurozone countries that it will be in@@ dem@@ ni@@ fied in any restruc@@ tur@@ ing.
Of course, the IMF@@ ’s member states might be willing to accept some burden shar@@ ing if a sufficient bu@@ ff@@ er provided by the eurozone were ero@@ ded, but that cannot be taken for gran@@ ted.
On@@ ce the first two el@@ ements of the plan are in plac@@ e, there should be little need for the third – bond purchas@@ es by the ECB in the sec@@ on@@ dar@@ y market in order to nar@@ row interest@@ -@@ rate spread@@ s and provide further confi@@ dence.
Indeed, if the ECB inten@@ ds to claim prefer@@ re@@ d-@@ credi@@ tor status for any bonds that it bu@@ y@@ s, it is probably best that it buy very fe@@ w@@ .
Of course, the ECB will have to continue to provide support to banks until confidence about their hol@@ d@@ ings retur@@ n@@ s.
But there is one more el@@ ement that is needed to ass@@ ure markets that the solution is politically vi@@ able.
C@@ i@@ tiz@@ ens across Europe, whether in res@@ cu@@ ed countries or res@@ cu@@ ing countries, will be pa@@ ying for years to cle@@ an up a m@@ ess for which they were not responsi@@ ble.
Not all banks vol@@ un@@ tar@@ ily lo@@ aded up on dist@@ res@@ sed government bonds – some were pressu@@ red by super@@ vis@@ ors, others by governments – but many have made un@@ wise bet@@ s.
If they are seen as prof@@ iting un@@ du@@ ly from the res@@ cu@@ e, even as they return to their bad old ways of pa@@ ying for non-@@ performan@@ ce, they will undermin@@ e political support for the res@@ c@@ ue – and perhaps even for capit@@ alism.
So a final el@@ ement of the pack@@ age ought to be a monit@@ or@@ ed p@@ ledge by eurozone banks that they will not un@@ lo@@ ad bonds as the official sector steps in@@ ; that they will raise capital over time instead of continuing to del@@ ever@@ age (@@ if this hur@@ ts bank equity hol@@ ders, they should think of this as burden shar@@ ing@@ )@@ ; and that they will be circum@@ sp@@ ect about bank@@ er b@@ on@@ uses until economies start growing stron@@ gly again@@ .
C@@ ries that this is not capitalism should be met with a fir@@ m re@@ tor@@ t: “@@ Nor are bail@@ ou@@ ts@@ !@@ ”
Afghanist@@ an’s future h@@ ang@@ s in the balance as its weak national government strugg@@ les to maintain support and legitimacy in the face of a wi@@ den@@ ing insur@@ gen@@ cy, war@@ l@@ ord@@ s, the her@@ o@@ in tra@@ de, and a dis@@ appoin@@ ted popul@@ ac@@ e.
Ac@@ ross an ar@@ c exten@@ ding from Afghanistan to East Africa, violence now also sur@@ ges in Iraq, Leban@@ on, Som@@ ali@@ a, and be@@ y@@ ond, to Su@@ dan@@ ’s Dar@@ fu@@ r region.

Stability will come only when economic opportunities ex@@ ist, when a bul@@ ging generation of young men can find jobs and support famili@@ es, rather than seeking their fortun@@ e in viol@@ ence.
We are se@@ eing again and again that a foreign arm@@ y, whether NATO@@ ’s in Afghanistan, America’s in Iraq, Israel’s in occup@@ ied Palest@@ ine, or Eth@@ i@@ op@@ i@@ a’s in Som@@ ali@@ a, may win a batt@@ le, or even a war, but never the peac@@ e.
Pe@@ ace is about dig@@ n@@ ity and hope for the future.

Pe@@ ace can be achieved only with a withdraw@@ al of foreign tro@@ op@@ s, and the ar@@ ri@@ val of job@@ s, productive far@@ ms and fac@@ tori@@ es, tou@@ ris@@ m, health car@@ e, and school@@ s.
Without th@@ es@@ e, military victory and occup@@ ation quickly turn to ash@@ es.
The United States government has pro@@ ven itself blin@@ d to these fac@@ ts, but the international community also remains ill equi@@ pped to assi@@ st in the restor@@ ation of peace following conflic@@ ts in im@@ pover@@ ished countries.
Re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly, a fragi@@ le peace has bro@@ ken down because of the lack of economic follow@@ -@@ up@@ .
Despite gr@@ and promises of foreign ai@@ d, economic re@@ construc@@ tion, and development in Afghanistan, Iraq, Leban@@ on, and elsewher@@ e, the ac@@ tual record of international assistance to post-@@ war re@@ construction is gra@@ vely de@@ fici@@ ent.

Rec@@ ri@@ min@@ ations fl@@ y, the occup@@ ying army rema@@ in@@ s, and a new insur@@ gency spread@@ s.
Many factors contribute to this dis@@ ar@@ ra@@ y, beginning with the shock@@ ing in@@ ability of the US, Europe, and the international organizations to understand things from the per@@ spec@@ tive of poor and disp@@ l@@ ac@@ ed people.
Their lack of emp@@ ath@@ y is de@@ pl@@ or@@ able, but there are conc@@ ep@@ tual problems as well.
The international agen@@ cies involved in post-@@ conflict re@@ construction have so far failed to understand how to start or res@@ tar@@ t economic development in a low-@@ income sett@@ ing.
It@@ ’s important to dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ish four distinc@@ t ph@@ as@@ es of outside help to end a conflic@@ t.
In the first ph@@ as@@ e, during the war itself@@ , aid is for human@@ itarian reli@@ ef@@ , foc@@ using on fo@@ od, wat@@ er, emer@@ gency medic@@ ine, and refu@@ ge@@ e camp@@ s.
In the second ph@@ as@@ e, at the war@@ ’s end, aid remains mainly human@@ itarian reli@@ ef@@ , but now direc@@ ted towards disp@@ l@@ ac@@ ed people retur@@ ning hom@@ e, and to de@@ com@@ mission@@ ed soldi@@ ers.
In the third ph@@ as@@ e, la@@ sting three to five years, aid suppor@@ ts the first ph@@ ase of post-@@ war economic development, including restor@@ ation of school@@ s, cl@@ in@@ ic@@ s, farm@@ s, fac@@ tori@@ es, and port@@ s.
In the fo@@ ur@@ th ph@@ as@@ e, which can last a generation or mor@@ e, assistance is direc@@ ted to long-term investments and the strength@@ ening of institutions such as cour@@ ts.
The international commun@@ ity, and the US in particul@@ ar, is d@@ read@@ ful at the third sta@@ ge.
On@@ ce a conflict is over, aid agen@@ cies seem par@@ aly@@ z@@ ed.
Inste@@ ad of sen@@ ding help@@ , they sen@@ d study group@@ s.
There is often a lag of years before moving from human@@ itarian re@@ lief to real economic development.
By the time such help actually ar@@ ri@@ ves, it is often too lat@@ e: war has been re-@@ ig@@ nit@@ ed.
In fact, it is possible to res@@ tar@@ t economic development through targe@@ ted “@@ quick@@ -@@ imp@@ ac@@ t” initi@@ ativ@@ es.
Since the economies of most im@@ pover@@ ished post-@@ conflict countries are based on agri@@ cultu@@ re, res@@ tar@@ ting far@@ m output is vit@@ al.
Im@@ pover@@ ished farm@@ ers should receive a free pack@@ age of se@@ ed@@ s, fer@@ ti@@ li@@ zer@@ s, and low-@@ cost equi@@ p@@ ment (@@ such as p@@ ump@@ s for ir@@ rig@@ ation@@ ).
When such aid is made available quick@@ ly, former soldi@@ ers will return to their farm@@ s, and can establish a li@@ v@@ eli@@ hood by the beginning of the first growing se@@ as@@ on following the end of hosti@@ li@@ ties.
This type of aid does not require long stu@@ dies, but qu@@ ick ac@@ tion.
Simil@@ ar quick@@ -@@ impact measures should be under@@ taken to control diseas@@ e.
S@@ m@@ all rural cl@@ in@@ ics can be built or re@@ built very quick@@ ly, within the first year of peac@@ e.
Sol@@ ar pan@@ els and win@@ d tur@@ bin@@ es can provide off@@ -@@ gri@@ d power in isol@@ ated rural are@@ as. W@@ ells and ci@@ st@@ ern@@ s can be put in place to ensure safe drin@@ king wat@@ er.
These and similar efforts can mean the difference between fam@@ ine and food security, epi@@ dem@@ ic disease and heal@@ th, income and ut@@ ter pover@@ ty, and, most importantly, hope and des@@ pa@@ ir@@ .
Yet the win@@ do@@ w of opportunity clos@@ es quick@@ ly.
Qu@@ i@@ ck@@ -@@ impact economic development is exac@@ tly what is needed now to help end the hor@@ ri@@ fic violence and suff@@ ering in Dar@@ fur@@ .
S@@ anc@@ tions, threat@@ s, and peac@@ ek@@ ee@@ per@@ s are only short-term meas@@ ures, whereas real progress there against extreme poverty is not only achiev@@ able, but also is something that the government and re@@ bel@@ s can agree on.
The same app@@ lies in Som@@ ali@@ a.
But the win@@ do@@ w of opportunity clos@@ es quickly in these and other post-@@ conflict region@@ s.
Only by taking quick@@ , mean@@ ing@@ ful action to fight hung@@ er, pover@@ ty, and disease can there be a chance of creating conditions for long-term peac@@ e.
W@@ AS@@ HI@@ NG@@ T@@ ON@@ , D@@ C – Is the Arab Sp@@ ring tur@@ ning into a g@@ lo@@ om@@ y aut@@ um@@ n@@ ?
With bru@@ tal cra@@ ck@@ dow@@ ns in Syri@@ a, a blo@@ od@@ y civil war in Liby@@ a, and Y@@ em@@ en te@@ e@@ ter@@ ing on the br@@ in@@ k of cha@@ o@@ s, the number of skep@@ tics is grow@@ ing.
Although Egypt and T@@ uni@@ si@@ a’s pro-@@ democracy movem@@ ents achieved rapid regime change, uncertain@@ ties remain in those countries, to@@ o.
After a bri@@ ef period of hop@@ e, many obser@@ vers now won@@ der whether the region is capable of produc@@ ing vi@@ able, and economic@@ ally vi@@ bran@@ t, democra@@ cies.
Revolu@@ tions and their after@@ ma@@ th@@ s, of course, are always flu@@ id and fi@@ ck@@ le tim@@ es, and the outcome is often per@@ ched on a k@@ ni@@ fe@@ ’s ed@@ ge.
Bri@@ d@@ ging the vast gap between high expect@@ ations and the reality of limited budge@@ ts and cap@@ abilities is a test in itself.
R@@ ed@@ res@@ sing past in@@ justice and building an economy that offers opportunity to all are major challenges as well@@ , f@@ rau@@ ght with volati@@ li@@ ty, uncertain@@ ty, and the danger@@ s of political opport@@ un@@ ism.
But transi@@ tions are also times of great opport@@ un@@ ity.
In the 199@@ 0’s, I was among those Indonesi@@ ans who de@@ man@@ ded and cel@@ eb@@ rated the de@@ par@@ ture of our own auto@@ c@@ rat@@ , Su@@ har@@ to@@ , and I jo@@ ined the new government when he le@@ ft.
Many obser@@ vers predic@@ ted that Indonesi@@ a, the world’s most popul@@ ous Muslim country, would be unable to su@@ sta@@ in democracy and would ultimately decline into cha@@ o@@ s.
The task ahead of us was da@@ un@@ t@@ ing.
But we pro@@ ved the skep@@ tics wron@@ g, and learned some fundamental less@@ on@@ s.
Perhaps most importantly, we learned that there is no one-@@ si@@ z@@ e-@@ f@@ it@@ s-@@ all solution for democrati@@ z@@ ation.
E@@ ach of the countries of the Middle East and North Africa will face uni@@ que challen@@ ges, which will have to be addres@@ sed on their own term@@ s.
Even so, they all must make a real and symboli@@ c break with the past@@ .
The new authorities must sen@@ d strong sign@@ als that the old ways are fin@@ ish@@ ed.
Ch@@ ange must be form@@ ally mani@@ fes@@ ted, with new laws that are widely publi@@ ci@@ z@@ ed.
L@@ eg@@ is@@ l@@ ation that em@@ powers citizens with freedom of ex@@ pres@@ sion, free and independent elec@@ tions, and freedom of associ@@ ation is cru@@ ci@@ al, and it must be made clear to the public that no one is above the law@@ .
An@@ y@@ thing less will undermin@@ e the transi@@ tion.
Moreover, corruption is the ban@@ e of development every@@ wher@@ e, so new governments should move fast to establish institutions and proc@@ edu@@ res to fight it.
Transpar@@ ency and account@@ ability are powerful ideas with ne@@ ar-@@ universal suppor@@ t, which means that new leaders should not give up when the fight becomes difficul@@ t.
C@@ i@@ vil@@ -@@ society organiz@@ ations, local communi@@ ties, represent@@ atives of the poor and vulner@@ able, and women play a vital role in this regar@@ d, and they should be inclu@@ ded at every level of decision@@ -@@ mak@@ ing.
In Indonesi@@ a, we signed a hund@@ red laws in less than 18 month@@ s, cover@@ ing everything from media freedom to elec@@ tions, corrup@@ tion, de@@ cent@@ rali@@ z@@ ation, and anti-@@ trust rul@@ es.
We rati@@ fied new public-@@ finance legisl@@ ation and ensu@@ red the independence of the country’s central bank@@ .
New leaders must also expect and manage set@@ back@@ s.
In post-@@ revolution@@ ary tim@@ es, expect@@ ations are high@@ , and the ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les to meeting them are enor@@ mo@@ us.
I know from personal experience that we did not always have the lu@@ x@@ ury of getting the best out@@ com@@ es.
We had to com@@ promise and sett@@ le for the best possible resul@@ ts.
Security threats are among the most serious set@@ back@@ s in transi@@ tions.
Nation@@ alisti@@ c senti@@ ment is stron@@ g, and politicians and interest groups can explo@@ it it.
O@@ f@@ ten, the security forces are hol@@ do@@ vers from the old regi@@ me, and there is no independent judi@@ cial system.
Reform@@ s will take time, and the old bureau@@ cra@@ cies may not be able to imp@@ lement them.
In Indonesi@@ a, we used various innov@@ ations to work around such di@@ lemm@@ as.
For example, we appoin@@ ted an independent jud@@ ge to take over the bankrup@@ t@@ cy and corruption cour@@ ts, because car@@ e@@ er jud@@ ges were too tain@@ ted.
Likewise, when we started c@@ ash@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ work programs as part of our pro-@@ poor agenda@@ , we asked communi@@ ties to run these initi@@ ativ@@ es.
More bro@@ ad@@ ly, new leaders are well advis@@ ed to ensure that the economy per@@ forms well.
It is important to restore economic ac@@ tivity and create a favor@@ able environment for entrep@@ rene@@ ur@@ s, particularly small and medi@@ um@@ -@@ size business@@ es, which constitu@@ te the main eng@@ ine of job cre@@ ation.
The recent revolu@@ tions, it should be rec@@ alle@@ d, started with the self-@@ im@@ m@@ ol@@ ation of a T@@ uni@@ si@@ an fru@@ it ven@@ d@@ or, who was har@@ ass@@ ed and ins@@ ul@@ ted by the authori@@ ties.
But economic success without account@@ ability and social inclu@@ sion is not sustain@@ able, and new governments often must face t@@ ough choic@@ es in order to protect the poor and vulner@@ able.
They might have to ab@@ oli@@ sh mis@@ -@@ targe@@ ted subsi@@ dies to free up resources for more targe@@ ted and efficient anti-@@ poverty and job@@ -@@ creation program@@ s.
In Indonesi@@ a, we had to draw a line between the very poor and the ne@@ ar-@@ poor@@ .
We could not afford to raise sal@@ aries or provide subsi@@ dies for every@@ bo@@ d@@ y.
Our help had to be targe@@ ted.
So, while we helped the nee@@ dies@@ t, we exclu@@ ded others who were not poor enough to benef@@ it.
This was a t@@ ough and un@@ popular choic@@ e.
Finally, countries in transition need support – not only mone@@ y, but also techni@@ cal know@@ -@@ how to imp@@ lement highly complex reform@@ s.
When I became Indonesi@@ a’s finance minister, I had 6@@ 4@@ ,000 employ@@ e@@ es.
But when we had to moderni@@ ze our tax system, we could not find the required exper@@ ti@@ se any@@ where in our country.
Y@@ es, we needed external assi@@ st@@ ance, but we never sur@@ ren@@ der@@ ed “@@ owner@@ ship@@ ” of the reform proc@@ ess@@ ; we made it work for us.
If we Indonesi@@ ans had not been in char@@ ge of our own transi@@ tion, it could easily have fai@@ led.
That less@@ on, too, is one that all countries in transition should be@@ ar in min@@ d.
Despite consider@@ able effort by the international community in Afghanistan since 2001 to elimin@@ ate the Taliban and al Qaed@@ a, the insur@@ gency in the sou@@ th of the country has ga@@ ther@@ ed moment@@ um at break@@ nec@@ k spe@@ ed in recent month@@ s.
Our fiel@@ d research shows that we are not winn@@ ing the campaign for the hear@@ ts and min@@ ds of the Afgh@@ an people – the Taliban ar@@ e.
Indeed, the international commun@@ it@@ y’s metho@@ ds of fighting the insur@@ gency and er@@ a@@ dic@@ ating po@@ pp@@ y c@@ ro@@ ps have actually helped the insur@@ g@@ ents gain power.
The international community has so far pursu@@ ed policies of destruc@@ tion, rather than the promised re@@ construc@@ tion.
The aggressive United Stat@@ es@@ -@@ led counter@@ -@@ nar@@ co@@ tics policy of c@@ ro@@ p er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation has failed to win the support of Afghan@@ s, because it has trig@@ ger@@ ed a ch@@ ain re@@ action of poverty and violence in which poor far@@ mer@@ s, with their only li@@ v@@ eli@@ hood destro@@ y@@ ed, are unable to fe@@ ed their famili@@ es.
This has been exac@@ erb@@ ated by the failure to provide even the most basic aid and development in the country’s poorest are@@ as.
At the same time, communi@@ ties have been tor@@ n ap@@ art as a result of bom@@ bing campaig@@ n@@ s, which have destro@@ yed the very hom@@ es we came to protec@@ t.
Th@@ is, in addi@@ tion to four years of d@@ rough@@ t, has forced entire famili@@ es to leave their v@@ ill@@ ages for mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft internal refu@@ ge@@ e camp@@ s.
Yo@@ u do not win people over by bom@@ bing them, but by helping them.
The Taliban have explo@@ ited the fail@@ ures of the international community in extrem@@ ely effective anti-@@ Western pro@@ pag@@ anda that has fuel@@ ed significant doubt in the min@@ ds of the public concern@@ ing the reasons justi@@ fying the international presence in Afghanist@@ an.
Sad@@ ly, our troops are often the first to pay the price – sometimes with their li@@ ves.
It is not too late to win back the hear@@ ts and min@@ ds of the Afgh@@ an people.
International troops are exc@@ elling in an excep@@ tion@@ ally hosti@@ le environ@@ ment, but this is not a war that will be won by military means al@@ one.
With public perc@@ ep@@ tion a crucial factor in winn@@ ing the war, and the Taliban po@@ is@@ ed to laun@@ ch a large military initi@@ ative next spr@@ ing, failure to adop@@ t a successful local strategy could signi@@ fy the last chance the international community will have to build a secure and stable Afghanist@@ an.
But a successful strategy – one that respon@@ ds to Afghanist@@ an’s extreme poverty crisis –@@ requires that the international community re@@ verse course on c@@ ro@@ p er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation.
In fact, the er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation of po@@ pp@@ y c@@ ro@@ ps not only damage local communi@@ ties and undermin@@ es the international commun@@ it@@ y’s go@@ als, but it is also fail@@ ing@@ : op@@ i@@ um production last year was at an all-@@ time high@@ .
In Septem@@ ber, the United Nations Off@@ ice on Dru@@ gs Cri@@ me announced that po@@ pp@@ y cul@@ tiv@@ ation so@@ ared by a rec@@ ord@@ -@@ high 60@@ %.
E@@ radic@@ ation will never be successful in Afghanistan, because it destro@@ ys the single c@@ ro@@ p that will grow in the sou@@ th@@ ’s har@@ sh climate – and thus ser@@ ves as the main source of income to millions of people.
So a new@@ , long-@@ ter@@ m, economic@@ ally sustainable solution is urg@@ ently needed – one that directly eng@@ ages with the communi@@ ties that are suff@@ ering most – in order to achieve the support of the deeply im@@ pover@@ ished rural popul@@ ation.
As a way to address this di@@ le@@ m@@ ma, the Sen@@ li@@ s Council is propos@@ ing to run scientific p@@ il@@ ot projects to research an op@@ i@@ um lic@@ ens@@ ing system for Afghanistan, which would be a core comp@@ on@@ ent of the economic re@@ construction process.
A system in which po@@ pp@@ y is cul@@ tiv@@ ated under lic@@ ense for the production of pain@@ -@@ kill@@ ing medic@@ ines such as mor@@ p@@ hin@@ e and co@@ d@@ eine would allow farm@@ ers to pursue their traditional li@@ v@@ eli@@ hood and way of lif@@ e, and, more importantly, to fe@@ ed themselves and their famili@@ es.
There is a global shor@@ tage of mor@@ p@@ hin@@ e and co@@ d@@ ein@@ e, particularly in under@@ developed countries, where these vital medic@@ ines are often in short sup@@ pl@@ y, if not comple@@ tel@@ y un@@ avail@@ able.
Not only would po@@ pp@@ y lic@@ ens@@ ing address the poverty and hung@@ er crises that have eng@@ ul@@ f@@ ed the sou@@ th of Afghanist@@ an@@ ; it also would stabili@@ ze existing local struc@@ tur@@ es, giving communi@@ ties a reason to support President Ham@@ id Kar@@ z@@ ai@@ ’s government and the international commun@@ ity.
F@@ arm@@ ers would gain a sense of owner@@ ship in counter@@ -@@ nar@@ co@@ tics effor@@ ts, in sharp contra@@ st to the current ide@@ alisti@@ c – and evi@@ d@@ ently un@@ -@@ achiev@@ able – policy of c@@ ro@@ p er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation.
We must have the back@@ ing of the Afgh@@ an people if we are to defe@@ at the Tali@@ b@@ an.
By end@@ or@@ sing such an initi@@ ative, the international community would demon@@ st@@ rate that it is in Afghanistan for the good of the local popul@@ ation, which would help farm@@ ers se@@ ver ties with the insur@@ gen@@ cy.
But for such a system to be success@@ ful@@ , the extreme poverty in the sou@@ th of the country must first be our top pri@@ or@@ ity.
According to the World Fo@@ od Progra@@ m, 7@@ 0% of the population lack food security.
An immediate in@@ jec@@ tion of emer@@ gency food and medical aid is urg@@ ently needed to break the vi@@ ci@@ ous cir@@ cle of suff@@ ering and viol@@ ence.
Only then could a new@@ , long-term development strategy in Afghanistan – one that ad@@ m@@ its that the international community is not winn@@ ing the war, and that the status qu@@ o is un@@ accep@@ table – be implement@@ ed.
L@@ ic@@ ens@@ ing the op@@ i@@ um c@@ ro@@ p would be a realisti@@ c and pragmati@@ c cor@@ ner@@ st@@ one of that strateg@@ y’s succ@@ ess.
G@@ E@@ NE@@ V@@ A –@@ S@@ wi@@ tz@@ er@@ land@@ ’s direct democracy allow@@ s citizens who have ga@@ ther@@ ed enough pe@@ ti@@ tion sig@@ nat@@ ures to challenge government policies and laws in nation@@ wide refer@@ en@@ da@@ .
After a sp@@ ate of AIDS death@@ s during the 198@@ 0’s, the S@@ wis@@ s came face to face with a problem that has destro@@ yed millions of lives in the United States, Russia, Latin America, the European Union, southern Asia, and other region@@ s.
In@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous drug us@@ ers – especially her@@ o@@ in ad@@ dic@@ ts – had turned public sp@@ ac@@ es in Zu@@ rich and other S@@ wis@@ s cities and to@@ w@@ ns into need@@ le par@@ k@@ s. AIDS pro@@ ved itself to be blin@@ d to aff@@ lu@@ ence.
The S@@ wis@@ s did not respond with the kind of neg@@ lec@@ t that Russia’s government has shown so far toward its her@@ o@@ in and HI@@ V epi@@ dem@@ ics – more than two million drug us@@ ers and an estimated one million people living with HIV@@ , over 60@@ % of them infec@@ ted while shar@@ ing con@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ ated need@@ l@@ es. Nor did the S@@ wis@@ s re@@ act with a “@@ war on dru@@ g@@ s” and massive funding for more polic@@ ing, more j@@ ail@@ s, and mand@@ atory pri@@ son sent@@ enc@@ es.
That war is well and truly lo@@ st.
The US now in@@ car@@ cer@@ ates more people than any other country, largely as a result of so@@ aring drug con@@ vic@@ tions, with a dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ate number of Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American and His@@ pan@@ ic prison@@ ers. The war on dru@@ gs has enab@@ led drug car@@ tel@@ s to rea@@ p higher prof@@ its than ever and trans@@ form entire communi@@ ties in Latin America into fi@@ ef@@ dom@@ s.
Dru@@ g money is corrup@@ ting democratic governments and law@@ -@@ en@@ forc@@ ement institutions around the world.
Dru@@ g-@@ related violence has consum@@ ed un@@ told numbers of victim@@ s in Afghanistan, Bur@@ ma, Col@@ ombi@@ a, the US, and Mexico@@ .
The S@@ wis@@ s re-@@ exam@@ ined their government’s drug policies with a pragmati@@ c ey@@ e.
He@@ al@@ th profession@@ als took the lead in a campaign to press the government – through the mechanis@@ ms of direct democracy – to shift its focus from ar@@ res@@ ting and pun@@ ish@@ ing drug us@@ ers toward public-@@ health policies that are based on scientific evidence of what work@@ s.
The S@@ wis@@ s implement@@ ed me@@ th@@ ad@@ one program@@ s. and, in order to prevent the spread of HIV@@ , they created need@@ le exchan@@ ges, including in prison@@ s, and established safe in@@ jec@@ tion ro@@ om@@ s on a large sc@@ al@@ e.
The S@@ wis@@ s Federal Off@@ ice of Pub@@ li@@ c He@@ al@@ th also over@@ saw an experi@@ ment in pres@@ cri@@ bing her@@ o@@ in to people who had li@@ ved with op@@ i@@ ate depen@@ den@@ cy for significant peri@@ od@@ s.
The S@@ wis@@ s government’s car@@ eful ev@@ al@@ u@@ ation of this approach demonstrat@@ ed that her@@ o@@ in-@@ assi@@ sted therap@@ y is both fe@@ asi@@ ble and cost@@ -@@ effec@@ tive, and that it can bring pati@@ ents significant health impro@@ vem@@ ents.
Moreover, it contribut@@ ed to a star@@ tl@@ ing dro@@ p in dru@@ g-@@ related cri@@ me.
The S@@ wis@@ s public was so convinc@@ ed of the benefits of her@@ o@@ in-@@ assi@@ sted therap@@ y that, in two nation@@ wide vo@@ t@@ es, voters end@@ or@@ sed the policy, despite domestic political opposition and critic@@ ism from the International N@@ ar@@ co@@ tics Con@@ tro@@ l Bo@@ ar@@ d.
S@@ wi@@ tz@@ er@@ land is a conservative country.
Tra@@ ff@@ i@@ ck@@ ing in illi@@ c@@ it nar@@ co@@ tics remains illeg@@ al.
In November 2008, the S@@ wis@@ s rejec@@ ted a proposal for D@@ ut@@ ch@@ -@@ style de@@ crimin@@ alization of can@@ n@@ ab@@ is.
And some policymakers question whether the S@@ wis@@ s approach has focused drug policy too much on public health and too little on de@@ aling with the poverty and social exclu@@ sion faced by drug us@@ ers.
S@@ wi@@ tz@@ er@@ land@@ ’s pragmati@@ c approach to drug ab@@ use has non@@ eth@@ eless yiel@@ ded significant lessons that are app@@ lic@@ able to the US, Russia, and the many other dru@@ g@@ - and HIV@@ /@@ AIDS@@ -@@ ra@@ v@@ aged countries over which they wi@@ el@@ d significant influ@@ ence.
So have similar approach@@ es in Portug@@ al, which only a decade ago led the EU in dru@@ g-@@ related HIV@@ /@@ AIDS cas@@ es.
Portug@@ al@@ ’s decision in 2001 to de@@ crimin@@ alize pos@@ s@@ ession of il@@ legal dru@@ gs led not only to more drug us@@ ers in treatment (@@ rather than in prison@@ ), but also a significant de@@ creas@@ e in the number of drug us@@ ers new@@ ly infec@@ ted with HIV@@ .
One lesson is the crucial importance of using scienti@@ fic@@ ally rig@@ or@@ ous investig@@ ation of new programs – rather than populi@@ st rhetor@@ ic@@ , religious mor@@ aliz@@ ing, and urban my@@ th – to gu@@ ide policy@@ mak@@ ing.
This requires coordin@@ ating polic@@ ing and health programs within a co@@ her@@ ent policy frame@@ work, invest@@ ing in research and public education on drug policy, opening new programs to independent re@@ view, and standing up to ideological critic@@ ism, both domestic and internation@@ al, with evidence and pragmati@@ sm@@ .
To con@@ v@@ ey these and other significant less@@ on@@ s, and to advoc@@ ate worldwide for effective har@@ m@@ -@@ reduction policies – and for broader public debate about more efficient and human@@ e drug policies – we and other world leaders have initi@@ ated the Global Commission on Dru@@ g Poli@@ cy, which held its in@@ au@@ gu@@ ral meeting in Gen@@ ev@@ a in Janu@@ ary.
Our a@@ im is to show that the war on dru@@ gs is lo@@ st.
S@@ wi@@ tz@@ er@@ land, Portug@@ al, and other countries have demonstrat@@ ed that there is a better way for@@ war@@ d, combin@@ ing pragmati@@ sm and cost effec@@ tiveness with comp@@ as@@ sion and respect for human righ@@ ts.
Will World Bank President Paul Wol@@ fo@@ wi@@ tz@@ ’s troub@@ les finally cat@@ aly@@ ze real change at the World Bank@@ ?
Will there finally be an end to the arch@@ a@@ ic practi@@ ce by which the President of the United States unilater@@ ally appoin@@ ts the head of the world’s most important development agen@@ cy@@ ?
Fac@@ ing an extra@@ ordinary re@@ bu@@ ke from the Bank@@ ’s ministeri@@ al over@@ si@@ ght commit@@ tee and open re@@ vol@@ t from his profession@@ al st@@ aff@@ , Wol@@ fo@@ wi@@ tz has f@@ ain@@ t hope of li@@ mp@@ ing through the last three years of his ter@@ m.
The immediate u@@ pro@@ ar is over the exc@@ e@@ ed@@ ingly gener@@ ous pay and promo@@ tion pack@@ age that Wol@@ fo@@ wi@@ tz a@@ war@@ ded in 2005 to his gi@@ r@@ l@@ fri@@ end as compens@@ ation for leaving the Bank to pa@@ ve the way for his ar@@ ri@@ val@@ .
At a time when the Bank has been empha@@ si@@ zing high governance standards as the key to development, the recent re@@ vel@@ ation of that arran@@ ge@@ ment@@ ’s de@@ tail@@ s have de@@ alt a serious b@@ low to the Bank@@ ’s credi@@ bilit@@ y.
But even if Wol@@ fo@@ wi@@ tz is eventually forced to res@@ ig@@ n, nothing will be gain@@ ed if US President George W. Bush is allowed su@@ mm@@ arily to choose his re@@ plac@@ em@@ ent, as US Pres@@ id@@ ents have been doing ever since the Bank was fo@@ unded after World War II@@ .
Instead, the Bank@@ ’s head should be cho@@ sen in an open and transpar@@ ent process that aim@@ s to sel@@ ect the best@@ -@@ quali@@ fied candid@@ ate, whether from the US, Europe, or the developing world.
Indeed, a big part of Wol@@ fo@@ wi@@ tz@@ ’s weak@@ ness today is the way he came to his job@@ , as an in-@@ y@@ our@@ -@@ face appoin@@ t@@ ment from a US administration weak at international cooper@@ ation.
The World Bank is a development finance institu@@ tion.
But Wol@@ fo@@ wi@@ tz@@ ’s back@@ ground at the US State and Def@@ ense De@@ part@@ ments gave him no real exper@@ ti@@ se or experience in either are@@ a.
Instead, his claim to f@@ ame was his role as arch@@ it@@ ect of America’s failed war in Iraq.
By all accoun@@ ts, Wol@@ fo@@ wi@@ tz is bri@@ lli@@ ant, but it seems in@@ conc@@ ei@@ v@@ able that an op@@ en, transpar@@ ent, and multilateral sel@@ ec@@ tion process would have cho@@ sen him to head the World Bank@@ .
I reach this conclu@@ sion even though I am symp@@ a@@ the@@ tic to the Bush administ@@ ration@@ ’s desire to cat@@ aly@@ ze change at the Bank@@ .
I have long advoc@@ ated shif@@ ting the Bank@@ ’s center of gra@@ v@@ ity from lending to ou@@ tri@@ ght gran@@ ts, a policy that the Bush administration stron@@ gly end@@ or@@ ses.
But cho@@ os@@ ing some@@ one with no obvious back@@ ground or experience in economic development was not the way to make progress on this fron@@ t.
A more open sel@@ ec@@ tion proc@@ ess, indeed, would have zo@@ om@@ ed in on the fact that Wol@@ fo@@ wi@@ tz@@ ’s gi@@ r@@ l@@ fri@@ end worked at the Bank@@ .
This may seem a tri@@ vi@@ al issu@@ e, but it is not, given the Bank@@ ’s strong policies to protect against ne@@ po@@ ti@@ sm@@ .
If Wol@@ fo@@ wi@@ tz were other@@ wise overwhelm@@ ingly the most quali@@ fied candid@@ ate, the sel@@ ec@@ tion commit@@ tee may have found a way to fin@@ es@@ se the issu@@ e, open@@ ly and transpar@@ ent@@ ly.
But, given his ques@@ tion@@ able f@@ it for the job in the first plac@@ e, the gi@@ r@@ l@@ fri@@ end issue might have been dis@@ quali@@ f@@ y@@ ing.
Why does the world me@@ ek@@ ly go along with the status qu@@ o and let the US dict@@ ate the Bank@@ ’s top posi@@ tion@@ ?
It is a sor@@ ry t@@ ale of poor global govern@@ ance.
Europe does not get in America’s way because it wants to maintain Europe’s equally out@@ -@@ d@@ ated pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge of appoin@@ ting the head of the International Monetary Fund@@ , the Bank@@ ’s si@@ ster institu@@ tion.
Asia has little choice but to def@@ er to the US and Europe’s sh@@ en@@ an@@ ig@@ ans because it is gro@@ ss@@ ly under@@ -@@ repres@@ ented in both organiz@@ ations.
As for Africa, its leaders are lo@@ ath to do or say anything that might inter@@ rup@@ t the f@@ low of World Bank lar@@ ges@@ se.
Many people, including my@@ self@@ , have long comp@@ la@@ ined about the leadership sel@@ ec@@ tion process at the World Bank and the IMF@@ .
How can the Bank and the Fund continue to go around lec@@ turing developing economies on good governance and transpar@@ ency but fail to allow change in their own hous@@ es?
Now and again, both organizations pay li@@ p service to the issu@@ e.
But so f@@ ar, they have ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ited no real desire for change.
To be fair@@ , the IMF@@ ’s leadership is making a determined effort to give dynam@@ ic emerging economies, particularly in Asia, a big@@ ger say in Fund govern@@ ance.
If car@@ ried far enough@@ , this process would ultimately cat@@ aly@@ ze the necessary chan@@ ges.
Unfortunately, the IMF@@ ’s re@@ balanc@@ ing efforts are proc@@ e@@ ed@@ ing at a gl@@ aci@@ al p@@ ac@@ e.
At the World Bank, nothing seems to be happ@@ ening at all.
Perhaps when G@@ ord@@ on B@@ rown becomes the U@@ K@@ ’s next prime minister, he will be able to con@@ vin@@ ce the G@@ 7 group of rich countries to lead the char@@ ge for change.
As head of the Fund@@ ’s ministeri@@ al over@@ si@@ ght commit@@ te@@ e, B@@ rown under@@ stands the issues as well as any@@ one.
O@@ r perhaps the Wol@@ fo@@ wi@@ tz deb@@ ac@@ le will prove to be the cat@@ aly@@ st.
Ma@@ y@@ be at la@@ st, the next World Bank or IMF president will come from outside their us@@ ual dom@@ ain@@ s.
There are pl@@ ent@@ y of great potential non-@@ American candid@@ at@@ es.
South African Fin@@ ance Minister Tre@@ vor Man@@ u@@ el has ably ser@@ ved as head of the World Bank@@ ’s over@@ si@@ ght commit@@ tee and would make a bri@@ lli@@ ant World Bank presid@@ ent.
And it still could be a quali@@ fied Americ@@ an.
What about Bill Clint@@ on@@ ?
One way or the o@@ ther, the Bank and the IMF leadership sel@@ ec@@ tion process urg@@ ently needs to be re@@ v@@ amp@@ ed.
What the Wol@@ fo@@ wi@@ tz deb@@ ac@@ le t@@ ells us most clearly is that the time for pati@@ ence with the status qu@@ o is over@@ .
CO@@ P@@ EN@@ HA@@ G@@ E@@ N – A gi@@ r@@ l born in South Asia or sub@@ -S@@ ahar@@ an Africa faces a cru@@ el dou@@ ble bur@@ den.
S@@ he will grow up in a region bes@@ et by pover@@ ty, diseas@@ e, war or fam@@ ine. S@@ he will also confron@@ t these challenges with the added dis@@ advantage of being f@@ em@@ al@@ e.
Although more attention is being given to gender issu@@ es, inequality persi@@ sts in every cultu@@ re, country, and contin@@ ent.
A new study for the Copen@@ hagen Con@@ sen@@ sus project shows that elimin@@ ating this di@@ spar@@ ity is an investment with high pay@@ off@@ s.
Despite global interest in education for all, many gi@@ r@@ ls in poor countries continue to be den@@ ied basic educ@@ ation@@ ; right from the star@@ t, they are dis@@ advan@@ ta@@ ge@@ d.
Th@@ re@@ e in five illi@@ ter@@ ate children in the world are gi@@ r@@ l@@ s.
Par@@ ticul@@ arly in South Asia and sub@@ -S@@ ahar@@ an Africa, cultural nor@@ ms and economic har@@ d@@ ships stop par@@ ents from sen@@ ding their dau@@ gh@@ ters to school or from ke@@ eping them in school for as long as they en@@ ro@@ ll their son@@ s.
This un@@ equal investment is neither equ@@ it@@ able nor effici@@ ent.
An obvious solution is to build more school@@ s in places where gi@@ r@@ ls and bo@@ ys must be educ@@ ated separ@@ atel@@ y.
In poor Muslim countries like Pakistan, Y@@ em@@ en, and Mor@@ oc@@ co@@ , sing@@ le-@@ se@@ x school@@ ing is the nor@@ m, but many rural areas can afford only one public school@@ , which is usually set asi@@ de for bo@@ y@@ s.
In the@@ or@@ y, about half of the education gap in these areas could be clos@@ ed by building gi@@ r@@ l@@ s’ school@@ s.
El@@ se@@ wher@@ e, supply constra@@ in@@ ts are not the problem.
Instead, policymakers must find ways to strengthen the incentives for par@@ ents to sen@@ d their dau@@ gh@@ ters to school@@ .
In countries where the fam@@ il@@ y’s cost of school@@ ing gi@@ r@@ ls is lower@@ ed either by a no@@ -@@ fe@@ e policy or by a sti@@ p@@ end for gi@@ r@@ ls who en@@ ro@@ ll in school@@ , gi@@ r@@ l@@ s’ en@@ ro@@ ll@@ ment rate increas@@ es.
The experi@@ ences of these few countries lead us to pro@@ pose a system wher@@ e@@ by mo@@ thers are paid if their school@@ -@@ age dau@@ gh@@ ters atten@@ d school regul@@ arly from the 3@@ r@@ d to the 9@@ th gra@@ de.
This would increase gi@@ r@@ l@@ s’ en@@ ro@@ ll@@ ment and also put money into wom@@ en’s hands – important because stu@@ dies show that money given to women is more likely to provide positive n@@ ut@@ ri@@ tional and health benefits for their children than money given to men.
It also provides the women with greater bar@@ gain@@ ing power in their own househ@@ old@@ s@@ . 
The annual cost per p@@ up@@ il would be $@@ 3@@ 2.
C@@ over@@ ing every eli@@ gi@@ ble gi@@ r@@ l in sub@@ -S@@ ahar@@ an Africa and South Asia for a year would cost $@@ 6 billi@@ on.
Ben@@ ef@@ its from increased future wages and the reduction in health@@ -@@ care use would be between three and 2@@ 6 times hig@@ her@@ .
P@@ reg@@ n@@ an@@ cy is one of the most vulnerable times for poor wom@@ en; 9@@ 9@@ % of the 5@@ 2@@ 9@@ ,000 women who die annu@@ ally from pre@@ gn@@ anc@@ y-@@ related complic@@ ations live in developing countries.
S@@ ever@@ e mal@@ n@@ ut@@ ri@@ tion and the absence of p@@ ren@@ at@@ al care during pre@@ gn@@ an@@ cy put both mo@@ ther and chil@@ d at serious risk@@ .
Sp@@ ending $@@ 3.@@ 9 billion on family plann@@ ing and mat@@ ern@@ al health initi@@ ativ@@ es, such as provi@@ sion of emer@@ gency contrac@@ ep@@ tion in sub@@ -S@@ ahar@@ an Africa and South Asia, could aver@@ t 1.@@ 4 million inf@@ ant death@@ s and 1@@ 4@@ 2@@ ,000 pre@@ gn@@ anc@@ y-@@ related death@@ s in wom@@ en.
M@@ aking re@@ productive services available to women who cannot afford to pay their way can help prevent these death@@ s.
But such services must not sh@@ y away from promoting and providing modern contrac@@ ep@@ tive metho@@ ds to avoid un@@ wanted pre@@ gn@@ an@@ cies.
N@@ early 20% of women in developing countries report that they would like to stop having more children but are not using any form of contrac@@ ep@@ tion or family plann@@ ing, possibly because re@@ productive services are not avail@@ able.
For ad@@ ol@@ es@@ cent gi@@ r@@ l@@ s, early mar@@ ri@@ age or an un@@ wanted pre@@ gn@@ an@@ cy typ@@ ically cur@@ tail@@ s school@@ ing.
Del@@ a@@ ying mar@@ ri@@ age and chil@@ d@@ be@@ aring allow@@ s them to gain more education and perhaps more ear@@ ning opportuni@@ ties, as well as improved heal@@ th, education, and labor market success for their future children – benefits worth ten times more than the cost of providing re@@ productive servic@@ es.
Other tool@@ s, asi@@ de from school@@ ing, can help women improve their in@@ com@@ e-@@ ear@@ ning ability.
M@@ icro@@ finance institutions, such as Bang@@ lad@@ es@@ h@@ ’s Gra@@ me@@ en Bank, play a vital role in allow@@ ing self-@@ employ@@ ed women to build profit@@ able business@@ es.
S@@ m@@ all loans em@@ power women by giving them more control over household assets and resourc@@ es, more autonom@@ y and decision@@ -@@ making power, and greater access to particip@@ ation in public life.
W@@ om@@ en are more likely than men to meet regul@@ ar re@@ pay@@ ments and to spend their ear@@ n@@ ings on chil@@ d@@ ren@@ ’s health and educ@@ ation.
Poli@@ cy@@ makers should continue to facilit@@ ate the ro@@ ll@@ out of m@@ icro@@ finance program@@ s.
Stu@@ dies show that each dollar lo@@ an@@ ed by a m@@ icro@@ finance institu@@ tion increases household expendi@@ ture by almost 10% in the first year, and that the benefits will continue for another 30 years. Ben@@ ef@@ its are estimated to end up about six times higher than the cost@@ s.
Th@@ ough women have the right to vote in almost every country, gender inequ@@ ali@@ ties in political represent@@ ation remain lar@@ ge.
Govern@@ ments should consider gender quo@@ t@@ as at the local level of politics.
Gre@@ ater f@@ em@@ ale represent@@ ation may not necess@@ arily lead to more empha@@ sis on “@@ f@@ em@@ al@@ e” policy priori@@ ties, but in India, vil@@ lage coun@@ c@@ il@@ s with gender quo@@ t@@ as for vil@@ lage chi@@ efs have higher levels of safe drin@@ king wat@@ er, better im@@ mun@@ ization cover@@ age and road@@ s, and less bri@@ ber@@ y.
There may be some losses from elec@@ ting women because they tend to have less political experience than men, but the record in India suggests that if it took 20 years to establish a 3@@ 0% share of women in local posi@@ tions in other countries, the benefits would be at least dou@@ ble the costs of achiev@@ ing this.
B@@ eing a wom@@ an need not and should not be among the greatest challenges of life.
CO@@ P@@ EN@@ HA@@ G@@ E@@ N – The past decade has pro@@ ven again and again that em@@ power@@ ing women worldwide hol@@ ds the key to sol@@ ving many seem@@ ingly in@@ trac@@ table issues that have other@@ wise sty@@ mi@@ ed policy@@ mak@@ ers.
P@@ over@@ ty in the developing world seemed in@@ er@@ a@@ dic@@ able until m@@ icro@@ -@@ len@@ ders saw millions of low-@@ in@@ come, des@@ titu@@ te women as potential entrep@@ rene@@ ur@@ s.
In@@ vol@@ ving African women in decision@@ -@@ making about c@@ ro@@ p production tur@@ ns out to enable environ@@ ment@@ ally sustainable farm@@ ing practic@@ es.
R@@ un@@ away population growth becomes controll@@ able when women have access to liter@@ acy and business opportunities as well as to contrac@@ ep@@ tion.
C@@ ould the ten@@ sions and conflic@@ ts sur@@ round@@ ing the issue of immig@@ ration in Europe be yet another issue for which the em@@ power@@ ment of women hol@@ ds a solu@@ tion@@ ?
In a recent visit to Copen@@ hagen to com@@ mem@@ or@@ ate International W@@ om@@ en’s Da@@ y, I took part in many con@@ vers@@ ations that du@@ p@@ lic@@ ate others throughout Europe@@ : citizens from across the political spec@@ tru@@ m were stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing with the issue of non-@@ European immig@@ ration and the cultural ten@@ sions that have ensu@@ ed.
What does it mean to be Dan@@ ish@@ , German@@ , or French in the presence of these millions of new@@ com@@ ers, most of whom come from non-@@ democratic socie@@ ti@@ es?
Some of this an@@ xi@@ ety is p@@ ure rac@@ ism@@ ; but some is not.
What would “@@ integra@@ tion@@ ” me@@ an, and how is it achieved without the loss of ch@@ er@@ ished ci@@ vil@@ -@@ society valu@@ es?
These are not necess@@ arily x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ b@@ ic ques@@ tions@@ : a post-@@ en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment civil societ@@ y, with a free press and due proc@@ ess, is a preci@@ ous th@@ ing, and those values should not be sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed to politically correc@@ t moral relati@@ v@@ ism.
This issue has been given new ur@@ gency by the ar@@ res@@ ts in I@@ re@@ land of al@@ leg@@ ed ji@@ ha@@ di@@ sts from several countries who are acc@@ used of p@@ lo@@ t@@ ting to mur@@ der a S@@ we@@ dis@@ h car@@ to@@ on@@ ist who dre@@ w an ima@@ ge of the pro@@ ph@@ et Moh@@ amm@@ ed as a do@@ g.
Ac@@ ross Europe, the discus@@ sions are growing more inten@@ se as anti-@@ immig@@ ration plat@@ forms gain suppor@@ ters in other@@ wise liberal countries, from Germany to France to tradition@@ ally inclu@@ sive and toler@@ ant Den@@ mark itself.
Th@@ en I witn@@ essed the pro@@ to@@ type of a true solu@@ tion.
I met Eli@@ sa@@ be@@ th M@@ ø@@ ll@@ er J@@ ens@@ en, the direc@@ tor of K@@ V@@ IN@@ F@@ O@@ , “the Dan@@ ish center for information on gen@@ der, equ@@ ality and ethni@@ c@@ it@@ y” – an extra@@ ordinary organiz@@ ation f@@ unded by Den@@ mark@@ ’s Minist@@ ry of C@@ ul@@ tu@@ re.
One of its many innov@@ ative programs is already show@@ ing results in terms of genu@@ in@@ ely integ@@ rating immig@@ rant famili@@ es into Dan@@ ish society.
By addres@@ sing immig@@ rant women – and by view@@ ing them as potential leader@@ s, rather than as qui@@ es@@ cent potential ma@@ id@@ s or service workers – K@@ V@@ IN@@ F@@ O is enab@@ ling their famili@@ es to witn@@ ess the benefits of an open civil society in their own li@@ ves.
K@@ V@@ IN@@ F@@ O began a “@@ ment@@ or net@@ work@@ ” aimed at immig@@ rant and refu@@ ge@@ e women in 200@@ 2.
By 201@@ 0, it had 5@@ ,000 particip@@ ant@@ s, had won a@@ wards and international acc@@ la@@ im for best integra@@ tive practic@@ es, and is being rep@@ lic@@ ated throughout Den@@ mark – and obser@@ vers are ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ing programs or partner@@ ships model@@ ed upon it in Can@@ ad@@ a, Spain@@ , Portug@@ al, and Nor@@ way.
The program pa@@ ir@@ s refu@@ ge@@ e and immig@@ rant women in a one-@@ to-@@ one ment@@ or@@ ing relationship with women who are established leaders at all levels of Dan@@ ish society.
The pa@@ iring is not cur@@ sor@@ y.
A car@@ eful mat@@ ch@@ making process un@@ it@@ es the interests and go@@ als of the women on both sid@@ es, and already has paid am@@ az@@ ing divi@@ den@@ ds.
W@@ om@@ en who were journ@@ ali@@ sts, engine@@ ers, or scientists in their countries of orig@@ in – and who could not get jobs as ch@@ eck@@ out cas@@ hi@@ ers in Den@@ mark – have been pa@@ i@@ red with Dan@@ ish counter@@ parts and are now back in school@@ , or working in resear@@ ch.
But even women who ar@@ ri@@ ve with no higher education or profession@@ al skill@@ s create an “@@ action plan@@ .”
They learn from their ment@@ ors what op@@ tions there are, how to proc@@ e@@ ed, and what to do to reach their objec@@ tiv@@ es. As they enter the work@@ forc@@ e, their langu@@ age skill@@ s impro@@ ve, their household income so@@ ar@@ s, and their children see fir@@ sth@@ and a wom@@ an in a respec@@ ted, economic@@ ally valu@@ ed ro@@ le.
Their lo@@ ved ones thus learn how to th@@ ri@@ ve in a European con@@ text – occ@@ a@@ sion@@ ally coming to K@@ V@@ IN@@ F@@ O events and benef@@ iting from their mo@@ ther@@ s’ exp@@ anding net@@ work of con@@ tac@@ ts.
So, rather than feel@@ ing explo@@ ited and condem@@ ned in@@ defin@@ it@@ ely to the f@@ ring@@ es of a Nor@@ thern European society – and thus vulnerable to the sti@@ r@@ r@@ ings of de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ es and extrem@@ ists – these wom@@ en’s children grow up fully famili@@ ar with Dan@@ ish civil societ@@ y, well inform@@ ed about higher education and profession@@ al opportuni@@ ties, and hop@@ eful rather than cy@@ ni@@ c@@ al.
By em@@ power@@ ing wom@@ en, the whole family is lif@@ ted up and, in a suppor@@ tive rather than a col@@ on@@ iz@@ ing way, “@@ Europe@@ ani@@ z@@ ed@@ ” in the best sen@@ se.
I am often stru@@ ck by the way many Europeans use arm@@ s-@@ l@@ eng@@ th eu@@ ph@@ emis@@ ms when tal@@ king about immig@@ ran@@ ts@@ : they want immig@@ rants to feel “@@ wel@@ com@@ e” or “@@ com@@ fort@@ able@@ .”
I always won@@ der, “@@ But do you want them to feel Fren@@ ch, or German@@ , or Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an@@ ?@@ ”
To be fully integ@@ rat@@ ed, Muslim and other new@@ com@@ ers to European countries must be wel@@ com@@ ed not as per@@ pet@@ ual visi@@ tors – even i@@ f, ide@@ ally, as ni@@ c@@ ely tre@@ ated visi@@ tors – but rather as family member@@ s, as the American model does (or as@@ pi@@ res to do@@ ).
As M@@ ø@@ ll@@ er J@@ en@@ sen put it, “@@ I want these children to feel Dan@@ ish .” These young people and Den@@ mark itself will benef@@ it, as this “@@ K@@ V@@ IN@@ F@@ O gener@@ ation@@ ” grow@@ s up with a genu@@ ine st@@ ake in Dan@@ ish civil societ@@ y, and se@@ eing the world as Dan@@ es, not as gu@@ est@@ s.
What will G-@@ 8 summit me@@ et@@ ings be like when American President H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton and French President S@@ é@@ g@@ ol@@ è@@ ne Ro@@ y@@ al join German Chanc@@ ell@@ or Angel@@ a Merkel in a form@@ id@@ able tri@@ ang@@ le of wom@@ en’s power@@ ?
The scenari@@ o is not al@@ together un@@ lik@@ el@@ y.
Indeed, in the United States and France, there are even alternative f@@ em@@ ale candidates for the presiden@@ cy (@@ Con@@ d@@ ol@@ ee@@ zz@@ a Ri@@ ce in America, Mich@@ elle Alli@@ o@@ t-@@ Mar@@ ie in Franc@@ e@@ ).
Will this mean a new style of both domestic politics and international rel@@ ations@@ ?
The answer is not ob@@ vi@@ ous.
After all, some women have long had the streng@@ th and the will to make it to the top@@ .
Th@@ in@@ k of Indi@@ ra G@@ and@@ hi@@ , Gol@@ da M@@ ei@@ r@@ , or M@@ arg@@ ar@@ et That@@ ch@@ er.
All three were powerful prime ministers of their countries, though perhaps not the ep@@ it@@ ome of what might be regar@@ ded as f@@ emin@@ ine valu@@ es.
They all out@@ did men at their own g@@ ame and had little time for what came to be called f@@ emin@@ ism.
Indeed, another tren@@ d may be more significant as far as political leadership is concern@@ ed.
When it comes to the form@@ ation of government@@ s, women have managed to break out of the pri@@ son of their traditional dom@@ ain@@ s, such as education and social affair@@ s.
Foreign policy in particular has become a f@@ em@@ ale as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tion.
Both the US and the European Union have women leading their foreign offic@@ es; so do half a do@@ zen EU countries, including Britain@@ .
H@@ as this changed the sty@@ le, indeed, the subst@@ ance of foreign policy@@ ?
Un@@ doub@@ ted@@ ly, a shift in policy sty@@ les is oc@@ curr@@ ing in many parts of the world.
In a wor@@ d, it appears that the Reag@@ an-@@ That@@ cher period is over@@ .
While oppon@@ ents of globalization still fight “@@ ne@@ o-@@ liber@@ al@@ ” policies, political dis@@ course has taken a new tur@@ n.
Wor@@ ds like “@@ j@@ us@@ tic@@ e” are back in fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ; there is concern about globaliz@@ ation@@ ’s lo@@ ser@@ s and the “@@ under@@ cl@@ ass@@ .”
Likewise, the leader of Britain@@ ’s Con@@ serv@@ ativ@@ es, David Cam@@ er@@ on, star@@ t@@ led more old@@ -@@ fas@@ hi@@ oned suppor@@ ters of his party by sa@@ ying that people re@@ leas@@ ed from pri@@ son “@@ ne@@ ed, above all, lo@@ ve@@ .” When Prime Minister Tony Blair descri@@ bed the next election as a f@@ ist@@ fight in which the “@@ fl@@ y@@ wei@@ gh@@ t” Cam@@ er@@ on would be car@@ ried out and the “@@ heav@@ y@@ wei@@ gh@@ t” B@@ rown vic@@ tori@@ ous after a short b@@ out, he go@@ t much ap@@ pl@@ ause from his suppor@@ ters in the Hous@@ e of Com@@ mon@@ s, but the re@@ mark went down b@@ adly with vo@@ ters.
Som@@ eh@@ ow, people pre@@ fer “@@ so@@ f@@ ter@@ ” values than were pre@@ valent in the last two decades.
Yet it is not the leading women who above all repres@@ ent these valu@@ es.
Merkel may have been so@@ f@@ ten@@ ed by having to pres@@ ide over a gr@@ and co@@ ali@@ tion, but her origin@@ al stance was more of the Reag@@ an-@@ That@@ cher vari@@ et@@ y.
Y@@ uli@@ y@@ a T@@ y@@ mo@@ sh@@ enk@@ o was clearly the most st@@ ou@@ th@@ ear@@ ted among the leaders of Ukra@@ ine@@ ’s O@@ range Revolu@@ tion, and no one has ever descri@@ bed H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton as particularly “@@ so@@ ft@@ .”
On the contrary, her possible Republican oppon@@ ent in 2009, Sen@@ ator John Mc@@ C@@ ain@@ , while a war her@@ o, is also a man who repres@@ ents to many Americans the new soft valu@@ es.
Merkel had a difficult time in the run@@ -@@ up to her recent party con@@ fer@@ ence, because J@@ ür@@ gen R@@ ü@@ tt@@ ger@@ s, the minist@@ er-@@ president of the largest German state, Nor@@ th@@ -@@ R@@ hin@@ e West@@ p@@ ha@@ li@@ a, remin@@ ded the Christi@@ an Democ@@ rats of their historical support for strong soci@@ al-@@ welfare policies.
Only Ro@@ y@@ al may be said to repres@@ ent so@@ f@@ ter lines against the har@@ d-@@ lin@@ er of the govern@@ ing par@@ ty, Nicolas Sarkoz@@ y.
So, have women at or near the top made no real difference to politic@@ s?
W@@ hat@@ ever change they have brought has not been ob@@ vi@@ ous.
In a sen@@ se, wom@@ en’s adv@@ ance is simply the normal consequ@@ ence of the gradu@@ al move to effective equ@@ ality of opportunity that began in the 1960@@ ’@@ s.
It took decades to become re@@ al, and there are still countries that have a long way to go@@ .
Despite T@@ y@@ mo@@ sh@@ en@@ ko@@ ’s leading role in Ukra@@ ine, it would be surpri@@ sing to see Russian President Vladimir Putin re@@ placed by a wom@@ an, and, while there is a f@@ em@@ ale vic@@ e-@@ president in China, there is no sign of a wom@@ an becoming Japanese prime minister so@@ on.
Even so, in many parts of the world, women have made consider@@ able head@@ way on the path to the top@@ .
Not in@@ frequ@@ ently this has been helped by exp@@ lic@@ it policies.
David Cam@@ er@@ on pri@@ des himself on a successful campaign to make 40% of all Con@@ serv@@ ative parliamentary candidates in Britain are wom@@ en.
But this is precisely the poin@@ t.
It is not the women at the top who have changed the sc@@ en@@ e.
R@@ ath@@ er, it is a more general tren@@ d, helped along by op@@ en-@@ min@@ ded leaders of both s@@ ex@@ es, that has changed the political climate in countries.
No one, man or wom@@ an, can today asp@@ ire to set@@ ting the t@@ one of public dis@@ course without recogni@@ zing that politics is no longer only a man@@ ’s gam@@ e.
In other words, nor@@ mali@@ zation by equal opportunity is itself the change.
W@@ hat@@ ever the particular values of leading candid@@ at@@ es, this is und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly progres@@ s.
The last annu@@ alized fig@@ ure for labor protests that Beij@@ ing was willing to anno@@ un@@ ce public@@ ly was 100@@ ,000 for the year 199@@ 9.

But a 2001 internal report from the Minist@@ ry of Pub@@ li@@ c Security disc@@ los@@ ed that the numbers "@@ began a rise like a violent win@@ d@@ " from 199@@ 7, the year of the Communist Par@@ t@@ y's Fi@@ f@@ te@@ enth Con@@ gres@@ s, which pressed for fac@@ tory fir@@ ings in the name of "@@ effici@@ enc@@ y@@ ."
While the government is determined to keep news of all dist@@ ur@@ ban@@ ces out of the medi@@ a@@ --@@ or at least down@@ play their size and dis@@ rup@@ tiven@@ ess@@ --@@ it has been possible to collec@@ t information on nearly 200 separ@@ ate events oc@@ curr@@ ing between 199@@ 4 and 200@@ 4, some from news sources in Hong Kon@@ g, some from the Western medi@@ a, and a few from Chinese public@@ ations.
They all ex@@ hi@@ b@@ it the sam@@ e, un@@ changing pat@@ tern@@ : the government, whether in Beij@@ ing or the loc@@ ali@@ ties, toler@@ ates the low-@@ deci@@ bel@@ , sm@@ all@@ er-@@ sc@@ al@@ e, relatively non-@@ dis@@ rup@@ tive mar@@ ches and si@@ t-@@ ins by demonstrat@@ ors be@@ aring pe@@ ti@@ tions and po@@ ster@@ s, especially if they appear to be sp@@ on@@ tane@@ ous, un@@ -@@ organiz@@ ed, loc@@ alized and leader@@ l@@ ess.
The inci@@ d@@ ents lo@@ om substanti@@ ally more dangerous to the political eli@@ te if they seem to have been mobili@@ zed by dis@@ sid@@ ents, are mark@@ ed by some measure of viol@@ ence, thre@@ aten to spread@@ , or ent@@ ail the ob@@ struc@@ tion of major tran@@ sp@@ ort tr@@ un@@ kl@@ in@@ es.
Indeed, the ep@@ is@@ o@@ des that make it into the media beyond the M@@ ain@@ land are usually such pro@@ test@@ s.
What is sp@@ ark@@ ing so much un@@ rest in a country usually dep@@ ic@@ ted as da@@ ily growing more aff@@ lu@@ ent@@ ? Gener@@ ally the causes are th@@ es@@ e: un@@ paid wages and pen@@ sion@@ s; sud@@ den and massive job ter@@ min@@ ations@@ ; and management corruption held responsible for the bankrup@@ t@@ cy of industrial enterpri@@ s@@ es@@ --@@ where di@@ sch@@ arg@@ ed workers were secu@@ re, enjo@@ ying pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ es and benef@@ its, since the 19@@ 50@@ s.
J@@ ob losses in the range of 60 million have sud@@ den@@ ly ren@@ der@@ ed nearly an ei@@ gh@@ th of the urban popul@@ ace in@@ dig@@ ent. O@@ ften without a depend@@ able chan@@ ne@@ l for air@@ ing their gri@@ ev@@ ances, hor@@ des of la@@ id@@ -@@ off workers and reti@@ red fol@@ k have fill@@ ed the a@@ ven@@ u@@ es over the past decade or so.
Do@@ es@@ n@@ 't the government min@@ d if so much of its urban popul@@ ace is sin@@ king into poverty and becoming disa@@ ff@@ ec@@ ted@@ ? Why is this stabilit@@ y-@@ ob@@ s@@ essed regime allow@@ ing so much inst@@ abilit@@ y?
In fact, the leaders are terri@@ bly un@@ easy about the situation and disc@@ uss it frequ@@ ent@@ ly. Some of the response has been col@@ dly co@@ er@@ ci@@ ve.
But there is also a compens@@ atory effort that has ab@@ sor@@ bed much of the energy of the bureau@@ cra@@ cies for labor and social security, and for civil affair@@ s.
For 200@@ 4, the central government alloc@@ ated some 7@@ 8 billion y@@ u@@ an for la@@ id@@ -@@ off workers and the po@@ or, with loc@@ ali@@ ties also u@@ pp@@ ing their out@@ la@@ y@@ s. But the sa@@ d truth is that probably only about a quar@@ ter of those push@@ ed out of their plan@@ ts ever received assi@@ st@@ ance.
For those who ha@@ ve, however, this policy has ni@@ pped dis@@ con@@ tent in the bu@@ d.


Ad@@ di@@ tion@@ ally, there have been attemp@@ ts to create new post@@ s, develop labor@@ -@@ inten@@ sive industri@@ es and small and medi@@ um si@@ zed firm@@ s, promote the private sector@@ , and encourage service job@@ s, pl@@ us off@@ ering occup@@ ational tra@@ in@@ ing@@ : the government alloc@@ ated an additional 4@@ .@@ 7 billion y@@ u@@ an ex@@ press@@ ly for job creation in 200@@ 4.
These policies mi@@ tig@@ ate the pa@@ in of job loss for their re@@ ci@@ pi@@ ents.
Pro@@ mo@@ tion of the law also aim@@ s at alle@@ vi@@ ating an@@ ger. As work@@ er@@ s@@ ' con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness of their rights increas@@ es, they are gradu@@ ally more and more ap@@ t to appe@@ al gri@@ ev@@ ances to the cour@@ ts@@ : from 199@@ 5 to 2001, adju@@ dic@@ ated labor disp@@ utes ro@@ se from 2@@ 8@@ ,000 to 10@@ 1,@@ 00@@ 0.
Off@@ ering workers legal re@@ d@@ ress has turned their attention tempor@@ arily from the stre@@ ets to medi@@ ation and may well have reduced the number of stre@@ et demon@@ stra@@ tions.
Other initi@@ atives are a program of allow@@ ances, tra@@ ining and plac@@ ement for the la@@ id@@ -@@ off@@ ; unemployment insurance (@@ wh@@ ich, un@@ fortunately, depends on the economic health of the fir@@ m to which a work@@ er was once att@@ ach@@ ed@@ )@@ ; and pension reform@@ --@@ having similar problems.
There is also a schem@@ e to supply a "@@ minim@@ um li@@ v@@ eli@@ hood guarante@@ e@@ " to the des@@ per@@ ately poor@@ .
R@@ eci@@ pi@@ ents num@@ ber@@ ed over 20 million as of early 200@@ 4, when 15 billion y@@ u@@ an was budge@@ ted for the program (@@ with the central government contribut@@ ing a full 60@@ %@@ ). These programs are no@@ tic@@ ed at the gra@@ ss@@ roo@@ ts, with the in@@ dig@@ ent feel@@ ing g@@ rat@@ eful for them.
Pro@@ test in China has sp@@ u@@ n up@@ ward dramati@@ cally in recent years, in num@@ ber@@ s, sc@@ al@@ e, and organiz@@ ation. But by the means li@@ sted above the regime has become a@@ dep@@ t at sup@@ press@@ ing opposi@@ tion.
Its power to in@@ tim@@ id@@ ate and pun@@ ish may tru@@ m@@ p all its other mo@@ ves to sta@@ y ahead of the dis@@ con@@ t@@ ent.
But over@@ all, increasing responsi@@ ven@@ ess@@ --@@ if clearly not in a democratic mo@@ de@@ --@@ has managed to maintain the inst@@ ability that does ex@@ ist at a level and within a sco@@ pe that mark@@ s a g@@ ame of un@@ w@@ ritten rules -@@ - one of comp@@ la@@ in@@ ants con@@ fin@@ ing their ch@@ ol@@ er within under@@ stood bo@@ und@@ s and of the government wat@@ ch@@ ful over an ever@@ -@@ si@@ m@@ mer@@ ing ste@@ w@@ .
CAMBRIDGE &#@@ 45@@ ;@@ &#@@ 45@@ ; Will the political res@@ ur@@ gence of labor uni@@ ons th@@ row a w@@ ren@@ ch into the whe@@ els of globaliz@@ ation@@ ?
O@@ r will their growing streng@@ th serve to make globalization more sustainable by fo@@ ster@@ ing great equ@@ ality and fair@@ n@@ ess@@ ?
One way or the o@@ ther, uni@@ ons stand as a major wi@@ ld car@@ d for the ev@@ olution of our economic system in 2008 and be@@ y@@ on@@ d.
Uni@@ on@@ s’ rising influence is evi@@ dent in many recent event@@ s: German Chanc@@ ell@@ or Angel@@ a Merk@@ el@@ ’s contro@@ versi@@ al deal to raise minim@@ um wages for post@@ al employ@@ e@@ es; several American presidential candid@@ at@@ es’ open mis@@ gi@@ v@@ ings about trade and immig@@ ration@@ ; and the Chinese leader@@ ship@@ ’s n@@ as@@ cent concerns about labor standard@@ s.
Al@@ ong with their political cl@@ out, uni@@ on@@ s’ intellectual respec@@ t@@ ability is also experienc@@ ing a ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance.
After decades of vili@@ fication by economists for raising unemployment and stran@@ gl@@ ing growth, the union movement is now recei@@ ving back@@ ing from thought leaders such as Paul K@@ ru@@ g@@ man, who argu@@ es that stronger uni@@ ons are needed to coun@@ ter globaliz@@ ation@@ ’s worst exc@@ ess@@ es.
The sud@@ den emer@@ gence of uni@@ ons as a political force is particularly surpri@@ sing in the United States, where priv@@ ate-@@ sector union membership has fallen from 2@@ 5% in 197@@ 5 to 8% today.
From high-@@ te@@ ch Go@@ o@@ g@@ le to mass re@@ tail@@ er W@@ al-@@ Mar@@ t, US companies have found ways to keep their sh@@ ops uni@@ on-@@ fre@@ e.
Only the public sector@@ , where the membership rate is 3@@ 5@@ %, has remained a union bas@@ tion.
One of my best fri@@ ends from chil@@ d@@ hood mar@@ ried a union organiz@@ er who found it so difficult to land a job in the US that he eventually mo@@ ved his family to stri@@ ke@@ -@@ happ@@ y Can@@ ad@@ a.
Today, US political leaders such as Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man Bar@@ ney Fran@@ k want to bring back uni@@ on@@ s.
But there is good reason to be skep@@ tic@@ al.
For a relatively poor country like China, real uni@@ ons could help balance employ@@ er@@ s’ power, bringing qu@@ alit@@ y-@@ of@@ -@@ life benefits that out@@ wei@@ gh the growth cost@@ s.
Fac@@ tory conditions in parts of China are all too remin@@ is@@ cent of the early twenti@@ eth@@ -@@ century, pre-@@ union US.
Th@@ ous@@ ands of Chinese workers die each year in co@@ al min@@ es that sometimes lack basic safety prec@@ au@@ tions.
But, for the US and rich countries in Europe, the argument that stronger uni@@ ons would bring more benefits than costs is far more du@@ bi@@ ous.
N@@ ow@@ ad@@ ay@@ s, most workers already have legal and stat@@ ut@@ ory rights that cover the basic protec@@ tions that uni@@ ons origin@@ ally f@@ ought for a century ago.
Instead, union influence today all too often ser@@ ves to pro@@ mul@@ g@@ ate inf@@ lexi@@ ble work practi@@ ces and fl@@ at sal@@ ary structu@@ res that do not adequ@@ ately re@@ ward work effort and skill@@ .
It is no surpri@@ se that the public sector@@ , where productivity is low and fiscal constra@@ in@@ ts so@@ ft, typ@@ ically has the greatest union concent@@ ra@@ tion.
Te@@ ach@@ er@@ s’ uni@@ on@@ s, especi@@ ally, are a c@@ atastroph@@ e, block@@ ing any ration@@ alization or impro@@ vement of many countries’ education system@@ s.
Be@@ fore the modern globalization er@@ a, uni@@ ons could th@@ ri@@ ve by organiz@@ ing on a national sc@@ al@@ e, giving them enormous bar@@ gain@@ ing power vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ v@@ is both employ@@ ers and consu@@ mer@@ s.
N@@ ow, after the explo@@ sive post-@@ war expansion of global tra@@ de, most uni@@ ons have seen their mon@@ opol@@ y power ero@@ ded, if not sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ed.
That is why uni@@ ons throughout much of the developed world have been fighting so hard to blo@@ ck fre@@ e-@@ trade negotiations that might ero@@ de their position fur@@ ther.
Some of the issues that uni@@ ons are promo@@ t@@ ing, such as human rights and environmental qu@@ ality, are un@@ as@@ sa@@ il@@ able.
When they try to con@@ n@@ ect these issues with tra@@ de, however, their mo@@ tives become ques@@ tion@@ able.
A case in point is union lob@@ b@@ ying against the US-@@ Col@@ ombi@@ a fre@@ e-@@ trade agreem@@ ent, rati@@ fication of which would great@@ ly adv@@ ance US-@@ Latin American rel@@ ations.
Legitim@@ ate questions about how the Col@@ ombi@@ an government conduc@@ ted its ep@@ ic civil war with dru@@ g-@@ financ@@ ed re@@ bel@@ s do not tru@@ m@@ p broader issu@@ es.
So anti-@@ p@@ act activi@@ sts have comp@@ la@@ ined that Col@@ ombi@@ a is anti-@@ union because it does not protect union members from re@@ bel viol@@ ence.
Yet the Col@@ ombi@@ an government no@@ tes that all Col@@ ombi@@ ans suff@@ er from re@@ bel violence – union members actually experience less of it than the rest of the popul@@ ation.
Unfortunately, this play is being re-@@ en@@ ac@@ ted across a ho@@ st of trade issu@@ es, including many invol@@ ving China.
For rich countries, income re@@ distribution is much better hand@@ led through taxes and benefits system, rather than by government e@@ dic@@ ts to strengthen uni@@ on@@ s.
The rich today pay so little in taxes in many countries, that it would be a big impro@@ vement simply to move to a fl@@ at tax@@ , with a very high ex@@ emp@@ tion level so that lower@@ -@@ income famili@@ es pay no@@ th@@ ing.
For m@@ idd@@ le-@@ income countries, it is a t@@ ough@@ er call@@ .
But her@@ e, too, increasing work@@ er@@ s’ legal and stat@@ ut@@ ory rights, while allow@@ ing most uni@@ ons to fa@@ de a@@ way, seems like the right approach@@ .
Unfortunately, we are far more likely to see uni@@ on@@ s’ growing political influence become a major destabili@@ zing force in trade and growth, with highly un@@ certain consequ@@ enc@@ es.
When we see political leaders in many rich countries p@@ ander to uni@@ ons by bas@@ h@@ ing each other on free trade and immig@@ ration, there is every reason to wor@@ ry about troub@@ le ahe@@ ad.
That is why uni@@ ons will be one of the main economic wi@@ ld car@@ ds in 2008@@ .
The eu@@ ph@@ ori@@ a of f@@ ans whose te@@ am w@@ ins a major spor@@ ting ev@@ ent is ep@@ h@@ emer@@ al.
But, promin@@ ent prof@@ ess@@ ors at Korean universi@@ ties tel@@ l me that the unpreced@@ ented success of the Korean te@@ am in the current World C@@ up competition is caus@@ ing a tur@@ ning point in Korean attitu@@ des towards their own society and economy.
Wh@@ y?
Many Kore@@ ans, especially those who stu@@ died or li@@ ved in the Wes@@ t, comp@@ la@@ in about the "@@ c@@ ron@@ y@@ ism@@ ", and the resulting importance of "@@ connec@@ tions@@ " in all wal@@ ks of Korean lif@@ e, which they see as per@@ v@@ asi@@ ve feat@@ ures of Korean society.
They claim that such ra@@ mp@@ ant c@@ ron@@ y@@ ism is prev@@ enting Korea from cat@@ ching up economic@@ ally with the Wes@@ t, despite the fact that Korea soon will have as much human capital as wes@@ tern countries.
To understand Korean c@@ ron@@ y@@ ism we have to see it as one asp@@ ect of a set of related social conven@@ tions.
Kore@@ ans accept a sense of know@@ ing on@@ e@@ 's place in society that seems extreme to Americ@@ ans.
In social inter@@ ac@@ tions, and also in business de@@ al@@ ings, Kore@@ ans maintain a hier@@ arch@@ y that seems to wei@@ gh age more highly than performan@@ ce.
Al@@ so, although ad@@ mission to eli@@ te universi@@ ties is as mer@@ it@@ oc@@ ratic in Korea as in the Wes@@ t, the outcome of the universi@@ ty ent@@ ran@@ ce competition has a more important and more permanent effect on on@@ e@@ 's place in Korean society.
It is only a s@@ light ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation to say that in America people have to prove themselves continu@@ ally, whereas in traditional Korean society people have only to prove themselves on@@ ce, then they can be set for life due in large measure to the net@@ work of c@@ ron@@ y con@@ tac@@ ts that ini@@ tial success will have provi@@ ded.
What do Korean c@@ ron@@ y@@ ism and related social conven@@ tions have to do with the World C@@ up@@ ?
In the past c@@ ron@@ y@@ ism appar@@ ently has been as per@@ v@@ asi@@ ve in the sel@@ ec@@ tion of Korean te@@ ams for international spor@@ ts competi@@ tions as in other areas of Korean society.
But, two years ago when the Korean so@@ cc@@ er fo@@ ot@@ ball associ@@ ation hi@@ red the D@@ ut@@ ch@@ man, Gu@@ us H@@ idd@@ in@@ k, to co@@ ach the Korean national so@@ cc@@ er te@@ am@@ , H@@ idd@@ in@@ k made it clear that he would sel@@ ect his play@@ ers based on mer@@ it al@@ one.
The performance of the Korean te@@ am in the 2002 World C@@ up competition is demonstrat@@ ing to every Korean in a way that is easily seen that mer@@ it@@ oc@@ ra@@ cy yiel@@ ds better results than c@@ ron@@ y@@ ism.
It also help@@ s that H@@ idd@@ in@@ k has been able to use his co@@ ach@@ ing skill@@ s to bring out in his te@@ am the strength@@ s of the Korean national character@@ : intel@@ li@@ gen@@ ce, discipl@@ ine, ten@@ ac@@ ity, and per@@ sever@@ ance.
Of course, Korean tradition@@ alists re@@ ject critic@@ ism of what wes@@ ter@@ ni@@ zed Kore@@ ans call c@@ ron@@ y@@ ism.
Tradi@@ tion@@ alists argue that critic@@ ism of c@@ ron@@ y@@ ism is really critic@@ ism of social solidar@@ ity and responsi@@ bilit@@ y, which they see as positive feat@@ ures of Korean society.
Tradi@@ tion@@ alists also argue that mer@@ it@@ oc@@ ra@@ cy implies individu@@ alism, and that too much individu@@ alism and too little social solidar@@ ity and responsibility are negative feat@@ ures of wes@@ tern society.
Some tradition@@ alists even might claim that they do not want Kore@@ ans to be as rich as wes@@ tern@@ ers if that requires Kore@@ ans to be as individu@@ alisti@@ c as wes@@ tern@@ ers.
The H@@ idd@@ in@@ k ph@@ en@@ omen@@ on did not emer@@ ge sud@@ den@@ ly out of thin air@@ .
The accum@@ ulation of gradu@@ al changes that have already occur@@ red in Korean society made it accep@@ table to im@@ port a wes@@ tern@@ er to co@@ ach the Korean national so@@ cc@@ er te@@ am and to allow him to establish a mer@@ it@@ oc@@ ratic regi@@ me.
But H@@ idd@@ in@@ k has ex@@ pe@@ di@@ ted the process of change within Korean societ@@ y, and his success has made it look revolution@@ ary.
It remains to be seen how fa@@ st, in what way@@ s, and with what effec@@ ts, Korean society will continue to change.
Kore@@ ans are tal@@ king about lear@@ ning the lessons of H@@ idd@@ in@@ k. But the wes@@ tern model of a mer@@ it@@ oc@@ ratic society is not easy to em@@ ul@@ ate.
A so@@ cc@@ er te@@ am is a relatively simple organiz@@ ation.
Imp@@ lement@@ ing the lessons of H@@ idd@@ in@@ k throughout Korean society will present more difficult challen@@ ges.
W@@ hat@@ ever the out@@ come, it seems that in the case of the 2002 World C@@ up the effects of success in a major spor@@ ting ev@@ ent will not be ep@@ h@@ emer@@ al.
M@@ ac@@ ro@@ economic policies, financial globaliz@@ ation, and changes in labor market institutions have exac@@ erb@@ ated inequality in recent decades, not only in income and weal@@ th, but also in access to education, health@@ car@@ e, social protec@@ tion, as well as in political particip@@ ation and influ@@ ence.
Even within countries experienc@@ ing rapid economic growth, an ar@@ ra@@ y of factor@@ s, exac@@ erb@@ ated by tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous demograph@@ ic chan@@ ges, has con@@ spi@@ red to trans@@ mit inequality of know@@ led@@ ge, social responsi@@ bilit@@ y, and life chan@@ ces from one generation to the ne@@ x@@ t.
As sur@@ ve@@ yed in the United Nations report The I@@ ne@@ quality Pre@@ dic@@ ament@@ , few countries, rich or po@@ or, have pro@@ ved im@@ mun@@ e to the global tren@@ d of rising inequ@@ ality, or to its consequences for education, heal@@ th, and social wel@@ far@@ e.
Of course, there is no simple caus@@ al relationship lin@@ king poverty and inequality to viol@@ ence.
But inequality and a sense of de@@ priv@@ ation do contribute to res@@ ent@@ ment and social inst@@ abilit@@ y, threat@@ ening security.
Ex@@ clu@@ ded and facing ble@@ ak life prospec@@ ts, young people, in particul@@ ar, often experience an@@ om@@ ie and may turn to anti-@@ social behavi@@ or, including viol@@ ence.
Nor is there a simple explan@@ ation of what causes pover@@ ty.
C@@ lear@@ ly, however, poverty ar@@ is@@ es from various complex condi@@ tions, and its am@@ eli@@ or@@ ation requires a multi@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al approach@@ .
It is hard to imag@@ ine, for example, how to “@@ make poverty histor@@ y” without also gener@@ ating enough dec@@ ent work, educ@@ ational opportuni@@ ties, and health@@ care for all.
To be sure, the world has seen progress on some fron@@ ts in recent decades.
Acc@@ ess to education for gi@@ r@@ ls has impro@@ v@@ ed, and some gender g@@ aps have been reduc@@ ed.
Despite AIDS and the res@@ ur@@ gence of mal@@ aria and tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ si@@ s, life expec@@ tan@@ cy has increased in much of the world due to improved public health system@@ s.
O@@ ver@@ all, however, the inequality g@@ aps are large and, in many cas@@ es, grow@@ ing.
The most important determin@@ ant of income inequality today is wealth inequ@@ ality, with the increasing concent@@ ration of asset owner@@ ship in recent years princip@@ ally responsible for greater income inequality in most countries.
Meanwhile, growing unemploy@@ ment, wi@@ den@@ ing sk@@ ill and productivity g@@ ap@@ s, and the “@@ in@@ for@@ ma@@ liz@@ ation@@ ” or “@@ cas@@ u@@ aliz@@ ation@@ ” of labor markets have exac@@ erb@@ ated income inequ@@ ali@@ ties world@@ wi@@ de, as the number of “@@ working poor@@ ” and the inci@@ dence of “@@ job@@ less grow@@ th@@ ” has spread@@ .
Nor have stabili@@ zation and structural adjust@@ ment program@@ s, imposed since the 198@@ 0’s, deliver@@ ed on their promise of achiev@@ ing higher economic growth.
Gro@@ w@@ th in much of the world during the past quar@@ ter@@ -@@ century has been s@@ lower than in the previous 25 years, despite more rapid growth in East Asia, India, and a few other countries.
Such growth differences suggest that overall global inequality may not have increased un@@ equi@@ vo@@ call@@ y.
But inequ@@ ali@@ ties at the national level have deep@@ ened in most countries in recent years, largely due to economic liber@@ alization at both the national and international level@@ s.
Indeed, in much of the world, such economic reforms have actually undermin@@ ed growth rates as well as the progres@@ sive role of government, while other@@ wise increasing overall inequ@@ ali@@ ties.
The few excep@@ tions have been due largely to continued or new progres@@ sive government interven@@ tions.
But they are excep@@ tions@@ : the cum@@ ul@@ ative impact of these reforms over the past 25 years has been greater inequality in most developed and developing countries, with rising unemploy@@ ment, greater ear@@ n@@ ings disp@@ ari@@ ties, reduced social protec@@ tion, and environmental de@@ gra@@ d@@ ation.
International financial liber@@ aliz@@ ation, for example, has undermin@@ ed the use of more inclu@@ sive and targe@@ ted develop@@ mental credit to promote desi@@ red economic activi@@ ties.
In addi@@ tion, contr@@ ary to the promises of its pro@@ pon@@ ents, financial liber@@ alization has actually resul@@ ted in net capital flows from the capit@@ al-@@ poor to the capit@@ al-@@ rich over the long ter@@ m, while increasing financial volati@@ lity and weak@@ ening economic activ@@ ity.
Meanwhile, fre@@ e-@@ trade negotiations seem to ignor@@ e historical tren@@ ds.
Develop@@ ing countries’ international terms of trade have wor@@ sen@@ ed@@ : prices of primary commodi@@ ties have decl@@ ined in rel@@ ation to manufac@@ tur@@ es, as have tro@@ pi@@ cal agri@@ culture prices against tem@@ per@@ ate agri@@ cultu@@ re, and prices of gen@@ eri@@ c manufac@@ tures have fallen relative to output protec@@ ted by intellectual property righ@@ ts.
As a result, trade liber@@ alization of manufac@@ tures has resul@@ ted in de-@@ industri@@ alization and greater unemployment in much of the world, as in the case of gar@@ ments this year.
And, while agricultural trade liber@@ alization may enh@@ ance export ear@@ n@@ ings for some poor countries, the main ben@@ e@@ fici@@ aries will be the more well-@@ to-@@ do agricultural expor@@ ters.
Coun@@ tries that im@@ port currently subsi@@ di@@ zed food will be worse off@@ .
The “@@ re@@ tre@@ at of the stat@@ e” in much of the developing world in recent decades has involved a generally reduced role for government, including the capacity to lead and su@@ sta@@ in development, as well as its progres@@ sive social interven@@ tions in areas such as public education, heal@@ th, hous@@ ing, and uti@@ li@@ ties.
The economic liber@@ alization car@@ ried out in much of the world in the last 25 years was a f@@ law@@ ed policy from the star@@ t, and its consequences have become g@@ lar@@ ingly ob@@ vi@@ ous.
Un@@ less the world re@@ foc@@ uses economic policies to address the ad@@ verse impact of economic inequality on growth and poverty reduc@@ tion, the poor and the pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ ed will continue to live worl@@ ds ap@@ ar@@ t.
CO@@ P@@ EN@@ HA@@ G@@ E@@ N – T@@ ens of thousands of people will soon ga@@ ther in Ri@@ o de J@@ an@@ ei@@ ro for the United Nations E@@ ar@@ th Sum@@ mit@@ .
The particip@@ ant@@ s, ran@@ ging from we@@ ary politicians to enth@@ usi@@ as@@ tic campaig@@ ner@@ s, are supposed to reig@@ n@@ ite global concern for the environ@@ ment.
Unfortunately, the summit is likely to be a wa@@ sted opport@@ un@@ ity.
The UN is show@@ cas@@ ing the all@@ uring promise of a “@@ gre@@ en econom@@ y@@ ,” focused on tac@@ kl@@ ing global warm@@ ing.
In fact, the summit is stri@@ king at the wrong targe@@ t, neg@@ lec@@ ting the much greater environmental concerns of the vast majority of the world.
Global warming is by no means our main environmental threat@@ .
Even if we assum@@ ed – un@@ reason@@ ably – that it caused all death@@ s from flo@@ od@@ s, d@@ rough@@ ts, he@@ at wa@@ ves, and stor@@ m@@ s, this total would amount to just 0.@@ 0@@ 6% of all death@@ s in developing countries.
In compar@@ is@@ on, 1@@ 3% of all Thir@@ d World death@@ s result from water and air poll@@ u@@ tion.
So, for each person who might die from global warm@@ ing, about 2@@ 10 people die from health problems that result from a lack of cle@@ an water and san@@ it@@ ation, from bre@@ a@@ thing smo@@ ke gener@@ ated by bur@@ ning di@@ r@@ ty fu@@ els (@@ such as dri@@ ed anim@@ al d@@ ung@@ ) in@@ do@@ ors, and from bre@@ a@@ thing poll@@ uted air out@@ do@@ or@@ s.
By foc@@ using on measures to prevent global warm@@ ing, the advanced countries might help to prevent many people from dy@@ ing.
That so@@ und@@ s good until you re@@ alize that it means that 2@@ 10 times as many people in poor@@ er countries might die need@@ less@@ ly as a result – because the resources that could have sa@@ ved them were spent on win@@ d@@ m@@ ill@@ s, sol@@ ar pan@@ el@@ s, bio@@ fuel@@ s, and other rich@@ -@@ world fix@@ ations.
But of course, poor countries’ tan@@ gi@@ ble poll@@ u@@ tion problems are not tren@@ d@@ y, and they do not eng@@ age ou@@ ts@@ po@@ ken campaig@@ ner@@ s, medi@@ a, and governments the way that global warming can@@ .
No@@ where are the failed priori@@ ties better illu@@ strat@@ ed than in the UN@@ ’s offici@@ al, col@@ or@@ ful “@@ Ri@@ o@@ +@@ 20@@ ” le@@ af@@ le@@ t.
Her@@ e, the UN hel@@ pf@@ ul@@ ly provides a la@@ y@@ man@@ ’s explan@@ ation of the sum@@ mit@@ , along with exam@@ ples of its en@@ vi@@ sion@@ ed “@@ gre@@ en econom@@ y” in ac@@ tion.
We see sc@@ ary p@@ ic@@ tures of dr@@ y ri@@ ver@@ be@@ ds (the result of global warm@@ ing@@ ), along with pl@@ ent@@ y of pre@@ t@@ ty solu@@ tions like win@@ d tur@@ bin@@ es and sol@@ ar pan@@ el@@ s.
The problem is that gre@@ en energy mostly is still much more exp@@ ensi@@ ve, less effec@@ tive, and more inter@@ mit@@ tent than the altern@@ ativ@@ es.
Yet, the summit liter@@ at@@ ure claims that it will boost economic growth and er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate pover@@ ty.
But seri@@ ously, why do well-@@ mean@@ ing Fir@@ st Wor@@ l@@ ders think that the Thir@@ d World should have energy technologies that are more exp@@ ensi@@ ve, fe@@ eb@@ l@@ er, and less reli@@ able than their ow@@ n@@ ?
Without a hin@@ t of ir@@ on@@ y, the le@@ af@@ let is called “@@ The F@@ ut@@ ure We W@@ ant@@ .” But, in a world where a billion people go to bed hung@@ ry, and where six million die each year from air and water poll@@ u@@ tion, most of those in the developing world likely have a very different set of priori@@ ties for their future.
The le@@ af@@ let che@@ er@@ fully claims that China’s shift “@@ to a low-@@ carbon growth strategy based on the development of renew@@ able energy sources [@@ h@@ as@@ ] created job@@ s, in@@ come, and revenu@@ e.”
In fact, over the past 25 years, China has qu@@ ad@@ ru@@ pl@@ ed its CO2 emis@@ sions.
While China does produce about half of the world’s sol@@ ar pan@@ el@@ s, 9@@ 8% are expor@@ ted to rea@@ p gener@@ ous subsi@@ dies from rich@@ -@@ world markets.
Only 0.@@ 00@@ 5% of China’s energy comes from sol@@ ar pan@@ el@@ s.
China’s decad@@ es@@ -@@ long economic expansion has lif@@ ted 6@@ 00 million people out of pover@@ ty, but the enormous poll@@ u@@ tion that this has ent@@ ail@@ ed does not f@@ it into Ri@@ o@@ +@@ 20@@ ’s gre@@ en nar@@ rati@@ ve.
Likewise, the bro@@ ch@@ ure expla@@ ins that some farm@@ ers in U@@ g@@ anda have emb@@ rac@@ ed organ@@ ic farm@@ ing.
Unfortunately, Africa is almost entirely organ@@ ic now – leading to low yiel@@ ds, hung@@ er, and de@@ for@@ est@@ ation.
Africa needs to boost its yiel@@ ds, and that means enab@@ ling farm@@ ers to use modern c@@ ro@@ p@@ s, fer@@ ti@@ li@@ zer@@ s, and p@@ esti@@ ci@@ d@@ es.
Pro@@ duc@@ ing less with more effort might appe@@ al to well-@@ f@@ ed Fir@@ st Wor@@ l@@ ders, but it is liter@@ ally star@@ ving the poor@@ .
Re@@ ad@@ ing fur@@ ther, the le@@ af@@ let g@@ ush@@ es that France has created 9@@ 0@@ ,000 jobs in the gre@@ en economy. But the stark reality remains h@@ id@@ den@@ : the average cost of each gre@@ en job is more than $@@ 200@@ ,000 per year, which French taxpay@@ ers pat@@ ently cannot aff@@ or@@ d.
And economic model@@ s show that France has lost as many or more jobs because of the ex@@ tr@@ a costs of the subsi@@ dies@@ .
Ad@@ ding ins@@ ul@@ t to in@@ j@@ ur@@ y, a be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ p@@ h shows elec@@ tri@@ c car@@ s fin@@ ish@@ ing the “@@ Zer@@ o E@@ mis@@ sions R@@ ac@@ e” in Gen@@ ev@@ a. O@@ mit@@ ted is the fact that most electric@@ ity still comes from bur@@ ning fossi@@ l fuel@@ s, so the car@@ s are anything but “@@ zer@@ o@@ ” emis@@ sions.
And, more importantly, most of our plan@@ et@@ ’s in@@ hab@@ it@@ ants still dre@@ am of ow@@ ning some form of mechan@@ ized tran@@ sp@@ ort – which is unlikely to be an elec@@ tri@@ c v@@ eh@@ ic@@ le with a price ta@@ g of $@@ 50@@ ,000 or more.
In a world pl@@ agu@@ ed by serious problems caused by air and water poll@@ u@@ tion, this bre@@ e@@ z@@ y focus on tren@@ dy top@@ ics and un@@ realisti@@ c solu@@ tions is deeply dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ing.
A dis@@ connec@@ ted global eli@@ te is fl@@ ying to Ri@@ o to tel@@ l the world’s poor to have a sol@@ ar pan@@ el@@ .
Ra@@ ther than p@@ ander@@ ing to advanced countries’ ob@@ s@@ ession@@ s, Ri@@ o@@ +@@ 20 could do more good for human@@ ity – and the plan@@ et – by foc@@ using on the top environmental problems and their simple solu@@ tions.
B@@ E@@ I@@ J@@ IN@@ G – On November 15 X@@ i J@@ in@@ p@@ ing became General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and Cha@@ ir@@ man of the C@@ C@@ P@@ ’s Central Milit@@ ary Commission@@ , giving him su@@ pre@@ me authority over China’s armed forc@@ es.
N@@ ex@@ t Mar@@ ch, he will become President of China as well.
How does China’s new leader see the world, and how will he hand@@ le the country’s foreign policy@@ ?
D@@ o his style and prefer@@ ences diff@@ er significantly from those of his pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ or, Hu J@@ in@@ ta@@ o@@ ?
The answer@@ s will determin@@ e China’s relations with the world, and vice vers@@ a, for the next deca@@ de.
China’s leaders approach power in a very different way than do political leaders in, say, the United Stat@@ es.
American politicians must sell their ideas and values to vo@@ ter@@ s; China’s leaders do not need to in@@ form the press and the public directly about any@@ th@@ ing, including their foreign-@@ policy posi@@ tions.
Indeed, with the no@@ table excep@@ tions of Ma@@ o Z@@ ed@@ ong and Den@@ g X@@ ia@@ op@@ ing, China’s leaders have sel@@ dom imposed their own person@@ ali@@ ties upon Chinese diplom@@ ac@@ y.
In this sen@@ se, X@@ i@@ ’s leadership style will most likely continue in the tradi@@ tion of his pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ or@@ s.
Nevertheless, X@@ i@@ ’s out@@ look and world@@ view are su@@ rely different from Hu@@ ’@@ s.
For star@@ ters, X@@ i is part of a generation raised and educ@@ ated mostly in China’s reform er@@ a, which has been a deci@@ sive influence in their li@@ ves.
China op@@ ened itself to the world in 197@@ 8, when X@@ i and his con@@ tempor@@ aries were young men e@@ ager to understand the world outside China.
They are a generation inspi@@ red by D@@ eng@@ ’s realisti@@ c approach to sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ing the w@@ all@@ s that radical le@@ f@@ ti@@ sts had built around China, and one that believ@@ es that knowledge can change the dest@@ in@@ y of the country and its people.
When this generation assum@@ es the man@@ t@@ le of leader@@ ship, its members will turn their pas@@ sion and c@@ uri@@ o@@ si@@ ty about knowledge and innov@@ ation into real work.
They are su@@ rely willing to learn from the wider world as they seek to promote China’s national interests ab@@ road and encourage gradu@@ al change at hom@@ e.
X@@ i may address Chinese diplom@@ ac@@ y’s th@@ or@@ ni@@ est issues – particularly Sin@@ o-@@ US relations – with more re@@ alism and flexi@@ bility than in recent years.
His visit to the US in Febru@@ ary 2012 was widely regar@@ ded as a sequ@@ el to D@@ eng@@ ’s visit in Janu@@ ary 197@@ 9.
X@@ i tal@@ ked to President Barack Obama and visi@@ ted the P@@ ent@@ ag@@ on. He gave a l@@ un@@ che@@ on spe@@ e@@ ch and saw old fri@@ ends from his bri@@ ef sta@@ y in I@@ ow@@ a as a young man@@ .
He show@@ ed interest in American cultu@@ re, just as Den@@ g did in 197@@ 9.
He ate ch@@ oc@@ ol@@ ate and wat@@ ched N@@ B@@ A gam@@ es.
Most import@@ ant, instead of spending coun@@ t@@ less ho@@ urs dre@@ arily disc@@ uss@@ ing political and strategic top@@ ic@@ s, he spo@@ ke directly and vi@@ g@@ or@@ ously about the current state of Sin@@ o-@@ US rel@@ ations. “@@ The P@@ aci@@ fic Oc@@ e@@ an is wide enough to ac@@ com@@ mod@@ ate the two major countries of China and the US@@ ,” he decl@@ ar@@ ed.
Un@@ happ@@ y with America’s “@@ pi@@ vo@@ t” to Asia, X@@ i remained cal@@ m, but empha@@ si@@ zed that “@@ one cannot rely too much on military power regar@@ ding Asi@@ a-@@ P@@ aci@@ fic diplom@@ ac@@ y@@ .”
Similarly, X@@ i tried to avoid major argum@@ ents on human rights, sa@@ ying si@@ m@@ pl@@ y, “@@ Th@@ er@@ e’s no bes@@ t, only bet@@ ter@@ .” In essen@@ ce, he sought to demon@@ st@@ rate that ho@@ we@@ ver many ques@@ tions, argum@@ ents, and even potential conflic@@ ts ex@@ ist between China and the US, both countries’ leaders should address them with an attitu@@ de of cooperation and sin@@ cer@@ ity.
Le@@ a@@ ders should not become ent@@ ang@@ led in de@@ tail@@ s that fuel susp@@ ici@@ on of their counter@@ par@@ ts@@ ’ mo@@ tiv@@ es, l@@ est they lose si@@ ght of the big@@ ger p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re.
X@@ i@@ ’s confidence exten@@ ds to China’s domestic politics.
His generation is more certain of reform than previous leadership co@@ hor@@ ts wer@@ e, owing less to official ide@@ ology than to the country’s enormous achiev@@ ements in the last three decades.
In practic@@ e, X@@ i may well prove to be a nation@@ ali@@ st@@ ; certain@@ ly, his gener@@ ation, like the found@@ ing fa@@ thers of the Peop@@ le’s Republi@@ c, dre@@ ams of tur@@ ning China into a stron@@ ger, more prosper@@ ous country.
The country’s new leaders want the world’s ap@@ pl@@ aus@@ e, but they are more e@@ ager for domestic o@@ v@@ ations.
Like previous Chinese leader@@ s, X@@ i firm@@ ly believ@@ es that the world should respect China’s authority to manage its own affair@@ s.
Thus, he is willing to show diplomatic mus@@ cle if China is challeng@@ ed on a core area of conc@@ ern.
His spe@@ e@@ ch in Mexico in 2009 demonstrat@@ ed this. “@@ Some foreign@@ ers with full bel@@ lies and nothing better to do eng@@ age in f@@ ing@@ er-@@ poin@@ ting at us@@ ,” he sa@@ i@@ d.
“@@ First, China does not export revolution@@ ; sec@@ ond, it does not export fam@@ ine and pover@@ ty@@ ; and, thir@@ d, it does not m@@ ess around with you@@ .
So what el@@ se is there to sa@@ y@@ ?@@ ”
X@@ i under@@ stands that the world expec@@ ts not only a better China, but also a China that is committed to construc@@ ting a better world.
He will be a t@@ ough and stron@@ g-@@ min@@ ded lea@@ der, but one who under@@ stands the world in a pragmati@@ c way and knows how to work well with his foreign counter@@ par@@ ts.
Indeed, his 2012 visit to the US left two im@@ pres@@ sions.
First, he is a leader at e@@ ase both in fron@@ t of and away from the tel@@ evi@@ sion c@@ am@@ er@@ as.
Second, he is not af@@ ra@@ id to have a little f@@ un@@ .
With those simple tou@@ ches of human@@ ity, X@@ i could bring a revolution to China’s diplom@@ ac@@ y.
NEW YORK – In Oc@@ tober 201@@ 0, the current bro@@ thers of George W. Bush’s former f@@ rat@@ ern@@ ity at Y@@ al@@ e, Del@@ ta K@@ app@@ a E@@ p@@ si@@ lon@@ , mar@@ ched through the fir@@ st-@@ year qu@@ ad chan@@ t@@ ing, “@@ No means y@@ es@@ !
Y@@ es means an@@ al@@ !@@ ” They held up sig@@ ns read@@ ing, “@@ We lo@@ ve Y@@ ale S@@ l@@ ut@@ s.”
Si@@ x@@ te@@ en gradu@@ ate and under@@ gradu@@ ate stud@@ ents, m@@ ale and f@@ em@@ al@@ e, fel@@ t that the universi@@ t@@ y’s administration then did little to push back against such enc@@ ro@@ ach@@ ments on f@@ em@@ ale stud@@ ent@@ s’ rights to a fair and non-@@ threat@@ ening lear@@ ning environ@@ ment.
In Mar@@ ch, they fil@@ ed a federal law@@ su@@ it against Y@@ al@@ e, al@@ leg@@ ing that its “@@ failure to address inci@@ d@@ ents of s@@ ex@@ ual har@@ ass@@ ment and s@@ ex@@ ual ass@@ aul@@ t has created a ‘@@ hosti@@ le environ@@ ment@@ .@@ ’@@ ”
The law@@ su@@ it did not stop with the D@@ K@@ E inci@@ d@@ ent.
Fir@@ st-@@ year women were rank@@ ed on their se@@ x appe@@ al, the comp@@ la@@ int no@@ ted, and, most seri@@ ously, Y@@ ale failed to respond adequ@@ ately to repor@@ ts of s@@ ex@@ ual ass@@ aul@@ t or attemp@@ ted ass@@ aul@@ t and stal@@ k@@ ing.
According to A@@ lex@@ and@@ ra Bro@@ d@@ sk@@ y, a Y@@ ale j@@ uni@@ or and one of the 1@@ 6 comp@@ la@@ in@@ ant@@ s, the students are “@@ really fru@@ strat@@ ed and dis@@ appoin@@ ted that Y@@ ale again and again fail@@ s to respond to both public and private ac@@ ts of s@@ ex@@ ual har@@ ass@@ ment and ass@@ aul@@ ts, wh@@ ich@@ …@@ per@@ pet@@ u@@ ates an environment in which th@@ es@@ e@@ …@@ ac@@ ts are ok@@ ay@@ .”
The stud@@ ent@@ s’ comp@@ la@@ int co@@ inci@@ des with a federal investig@@ ation by the De@@ part@@ ment of E@@ duc@@ ation@@ ’s Off@@ ice for C@@ i@@ vi@@ l R@@ igh@@ ts, which announced that it would re@@ view Y@@ al@@ e’s policies for de@@ aling with s@@ ex@@ ual har@@ ass@@ ment and s@@ ex@@ ual ass@@ aul@@ t.
This is no small mat@@ ter@@ : Y@@ ale and other American universi@@ ties receive millions of federal dollars annu@@ ally – money that would be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed if the universi@@ ty was found to toler@@ ate an un@@ equal lear@@ ning environ@@ ment.
In 200@@ 4, I w@@ ro@@ te an ar@@ tic@@ le for New York ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine about my own experience of having been s@@ ex@@ ually enc@@ ro@@ ach@@ ed upon as a thir@@ d-@@ year under@@ gradu@@ ate at Y@@ ale by an es@@ te@@ em@@ ed prof@@ ess@@ or (the cri@@ me of “@@ s@@ ex@@ ual har@@ ass@@ ment@@ ” had not yet been co@@ di@@ fi@@ ed@@ ).
I w@@ ro@@ te, too, about Y@@ al@@ e’s cover@@ -@@ up of many situ@@ ations like min@@ e.
So the stud@@ ent@@ s’ law@@ su@@ it was not surpri@@ sing to me.
Indeed, in the course of trying to report to the universi@@ ty in 2004 what had happened to me in 198@@ 3, I found the same pat@@ tern of st@@ on@@ e@@ w@@ all@@ ing victim@@ s and def@@ ending per@@ pet@@ rat@@ or@@ s.
Wor@@ se still@@ , I dis@@ cover@@ ed that the universi@@ ty and its law@@ y@@ ers used the s@@ ex@@ ual har@@ ass@@ ment “@@ gri@@ ev@@ ance proc@@ edu@@ re@@ ” as a s@@ cre@@ en to protect the institu@@ tion, its har@@ asser@@ s, and even its rap@@ ist@@ s, rather than as a means to investig@@ ate inci@@ d@@ ents of ab@@ us@@ e.
This situation had persi@@ sted for two decades.
As I conduc@@ ted my re@@ port@@ ing, I hear@@ d wom@@ an after wom@@ an alle@@ ge that the same prof@@ ess@@ or or the same f@@ rat@@ ern@@ ity had eng@@ aged in multi@@ ple in@@ stan@@ ces of ass@@ aul@@ t or har@@ ass@@ ment.
V@@ ic@@ ti@@ m after vic@@ ti@@ m would p@@ lead@@ , hear@@ t@@ break@@ ing@@ ly, “@@ H@@ el@@ p me@@ .”
But I could do no@@ th@@ ing, because the women ch@@ ose to remain an@@ on@@ y@@ mo@@ us, and because the universi@@ ty tre@@ ated each case as top secre@@ t.
Al@@ leg@@ ed per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors were free to te@@ ach in a new universi@@ ty – where more young women (and in some cas@@ es, young men@@ ) would become their pre@@ y.
Com@@ po@@ und@@ ing the lack of transpar@@ enc@@ y, Y@@ ale main@@ tains its own camp@@ us police forc@@ e, to which s@@ ex@@ -@@ cri@@ me victim@@ s are encoura@@ ged to report their comp@@ la@@ in@@ ts if they insi@@ st upon form@@ al docum@@ ent@@ ation.
But victim@@ s often do not understand that this actually ten@@ ds to con@@ tain potentially em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ sing sc@@ and@@ als, by prev@@ enting real – that is, accoun@@ table – law en@@ forc@@ ement from getting invol@@ v@@ ed.
Indeed, there have been disc@@ los@@ ed to me repor@@ ts of at least three al@@ leg@@ ed se@@ x ass@@ aul@@ ts by fac@@ ul@@ ty or academ@@ ic st@@ af@@ f in the past decade – two al@@ leg@@ ed inci@@ d@@ ents repor@@ ted by two different women invol@@ ving the same man@@ .
I know that one under@@ gradu@@ ate has more recently pursu@@ ed legal action against a st@@ af@@ f member@@ , wh@@ o, she sa@@ id, dru@@ g@@ ged her with Roh@@ yp@@ n@@ ol@@ , the “@@ d@@ ate ra@@ pe@@ ” dru@@ g, and ass@@ aul@@ ted her@@ .
I know these accoun@@ ts, but I can@@ ’t report them, even at this critical moment in the long-@@ over@@ due form@@ al investig@@ ation, because of confi@@ denti@@ ality pro@@ to@@ col@@ s.
E@@ ach of these women fe@@ els al@@ one.
Like virtually every private universi@@ ty in the United States, Y@@ ale has reli@@ ed on “@@ priv@@ ac@@ y” to keep these inci@@ d@@ ents under w@@ rap@@ s, so that in@@ coming women (and men@@ ) have no idea who among the fac@@ ul@@ ty or students is danger@@ ous@@ ; which f@@ rat@@ ern@@ ity is a si@@ te of repe@@ ated har@@ ass@@ ment or wor@@ se@@ ; and when to keep the do@@ or open on a stud@@ ent-@@ teach@@ er me@@ et@@ ing.
Like the C@@ atholi@@ c Ch@@ ur@@ ch, private universi@@ ties like Y@@ ale can use victim@@ s’ sh@@ ame and isol@@ ation to di@@ sen@@ fran@@ ch@@ ise them and to protect the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ or@@ s.
But I believe that the victim@@ s themselves have a responsi@@ bilit@@ y.
The con@@ vention of taking s@@ ex@@ -@@ cri@@ me tes@@ tim@@ ony from al@@ leg@@ ed victim@@ s behind clos@@ ed do@@ ors, under conditions of an@@ on@@ y@@ mit@@ y or confi@@ denti@@ ality, only ser@@ ves institutions like universi@@ ties or the military that are in@@ tent on cover@@ ing up crimin@@ al behavi@@ or.
Some f@@ emin@@ ists have attack@@ ed me for this posi@@ tion, but the numbers be@@ ar me out@@ : thir@@ ty years ago, 3@@ 0% of repor@@ ted rap@@ es in the US and the United King@@ dom resul@@ ted in pro@@ secu@@ tions@@ ; today, after three decades of confi@@ denti@@ al s@@ ex@@ -@@ cri@@ me re@@ port@@ ing, the number is 1@@ 2% in the US and 6% in the U@@ K@@ .
This is largely because confi@@ denti@@ ality in s@@ ex@@ -@@ cri@@ me repor@@ ting prev@@ ents the media from sh@@ ining a light on the cri@@ me, in@@ hi@@ b@@ its institutional mem@@ ory of repe@@ ated as@@ sa@@ il@@ ant@@ s, and prev@@ ents sc@@ ru@@ tin@@ y of whether a cour@@ t, colle@@ ge, or police prec@@ inc@@ t is doing better or worse at handl@@ ing such cas@@ es.
As a result, serious crimes can be s@@ we@@ p@@ t under the ru@@ g – at Y@@ ale and at every other private US universi@@ ty I have ever visi@@ ted (@@ public universi@@ ties are less free to conc@@ e@@ al cri@@ me dat@@ a@@ ) – in the gu@@ ise of “@@ protec@@ ting the victim@@ s.”
Y@@ ale al@@ um@@ n@@ a@@ e are repor@@ tedly now con@@ tac@@ ting these 1@@ 6 students with their own st@@ ories of s@@ ex@@ ual ass@@ aul@@ t and har@@ ass@@ ment, sp@@ ann@@ ing two decades.
But if they had come forward public@@ ly years ago, it is likely that Y@@ ale could not have continued for so long to protect the se@@ x crimin@@ als in its mid@@ st.
The students are righ@@ t: a s@@ ex@@ ually ab@@ u@@ sive environment does make it har@@ der for students to study and lear@@ n.
But victim@@ s – whether current students or al@@ um@@ n@@ a@@ e – would be well advis@@ ed to take a deep bre@@ a@@ th, come for@@ war@@ d, and tel@@ l their st@@ ories out l@@ ou@@ d.
Only then would Y@@ ale and other institutions be forced to reck@@ on public@@ ly with a problem that has persi@@ sted for gener@@ ations.
R@@ I@@ O D@@ E J@@ A@@ NE@@ I@@ R@@ O – Last mon@@ th, the leaders of all 12 countries of South America (@@ exc@@ ept on@@ e) ga@@ ther@@ ed in Qu@@ it@@ o, E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or@@ ’s capit@@ al, for the summit of the Union of South American Nation@@ s.

Th@@ anks to America’s recently announced military agreement with Col@@ ombi@@ a, Cháve@@ z@@ ’s ideas go@@ t more of a hear@@ ing than might have been expec@@ ted.
For@@ , instead of infrastructure plan@@ s, commercial or environmental tre@@ ati@@ es, or even multilateral action against such common problems as violence and pover@@ ty, the issue that domin@@ ated both press accoun@@ ts and the spe@@ ech@@ es at the ga@@ ther@@ ing was the new US-@@ Col@@ ombi@@ an military agreem@@ ent, announced less than a month before the sum@@ mit@@ .
To no one’s surpri@@ se, Chávez domin@@ ated the critic@@ ism of the p@@ ac@@ t.
He claim@@ ed that the “@@ Win@@ ds of war are b@@ low@@ ing@@ ,” and that the announc@@ ement of the military agreement “@@ can trans@@ form itself into a tra@@ ge@@ dy@@ .”
Unfortunately, Col@@ ombi@@ an President Á@@ l@@ v@@ ar@@ o U@@ ri@@ be was ab@@ sent from the me@@ et@@ ing.

So U@@ ri@@ be could not def@@ end the new military agreem@@ ent.
This left the flo@@ or open to Chávez to isol@@ ate Col@@ ombi@@ a and pre@@ ach against the US.
In a contin@@ ent where anti-@@ Americ@@ an@@ ism remains both very popular and an effective way to consolid@@ ate national co@@ h@@ esi@@ on and political power, Cháve@@ z@@ ’s attacks found a ready au@@ di@@ ence.
In addi@@ tion, U@@ ri@@ be@@ ’s absence allowed Chávez to avoid respon@@ ding to Col@@ ombi@@ a’s acc@@ us@@ ations that Venezuel@@ a and its ally E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or support the nar@@ co-@@ Mar@@ x@@ ist F@@ AR@@ C@@ .
One we@@ ek after the sum@@ mit@@ , US Secretary of State H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton tried to cal@@ m the contin@@ ent@@ ’s fear@@ s about the US-@@ Col@@ ombi@@ a agreem@@ ent, expla@@ ining that it is merely a min@@ or re@@ vision of the Bill Clint@@ on-@@ era Plan Col@@ ombi@@ a, an American program to support the government against the drug car@@ tel@@ s.
But her wor@@ ds did little so@@ o@@ th@@ ing.
Nor did it seem to help that even most local military analy@@ sts say that the agreement does not repres@@ ent any major change in the US military position on the contin@@ ent.
The simple fact is that the tim@@ ing of the announc@@ ement of the p@@ act was terri@@ ble, and gave a plat@@ form for Boli@@ vari@@ an rants that will not be without consequ@@ enc@@ es.
Indeed, the ongoing fall@@ out is likely to remain very neg@@ ativ@@ e.
By raising anti-@@ American susp@@ ici@@ ons and strength@@ ening Cháve@@ z@@ ’s position across the contin@@ ent, the agreement weak@@ ens the influence of Braz@@ il.
Rec@@ ently, Brazi@@ l had been differ@@ enti@@ ating itself from the rest of the contin@@ ent through its stable economy and vi@@ b@@ rant democratic political system, both of which were helping the country’s poor@@ .
So the spread and strength@@ ening of Cháve@@ z@@ ’s so-called Boli@@ vari@@ an Revolution was not in Braz@@ il@@ ’s interest@@ s, even though some of President Lu@@ i@@ z In@@ á@@ ci@@ o L@@ ula da S@@ il@@ v@@ a’s officials appear to be f@@ ans of Chávez and his administ@@ ra@@ tion.
The terri@@ ble tim@@ ing of the US-@@ Col@@ ombi@@ a military agreement also gave Chávez and his allies a reason to build up their ar@@ mi@@ es against the “@@ evi@@ l imperi@@ alist i@@ an@@ que .”
After all, one must re@@ member@@ , the Boli@@ vari@@ an Revolu@@ tion@@ ’s supposed “@@ enem@@ y” is the US, and no one el@@ se.
So the agreement may legitim@@ i@@ ze and produce an arms ra@@ ce in South America, which is in no one’s interes@@ t.
Another un@@ expected consequ@@ ence of the US-@@ Col@@ ombi@@ a military agreement may be a further hei@@ ghten@@ ing of ten@@ sions between Venezuel@@ a and Col@@ ombi@@ a.
The radical pol@@ ari@@ zation of the An@@ de@@ an region between those two countries will create difficul@@ ties in building regional consensus and security problems in the A@@ ma@@ z@@ on, as well as weak@@ ening the Brazi@@ li@@ an project for South American political and economic integra@@ tion.
Finally, another major consequ@@ ence of the US-@@ Col@@ ombi@@ a deal are the doub@@ ts that it has created in Latin America about President Barack Obama’s administ@@ ration, and about the future of relations between the US and South America, especially Braz@@ il, the main regional power.
The agreement revi@@ ved the perc@@ ep@@ tion that US diplom@@ acy lack@@ s sensi@@ tivity where the region is concern@@ ed.
If Obama wants to encourage moderate and democratic politics in South America, and to bol@@ ster Braz@@ il@@ ’s efforts to fo@@ ster stability and economic progress against the region’s radical and un@@ democratic forc@@ es, it must take greater care in not appe@@ aring to undermin@@ e those the US claims to suppor@@ t.
For Chávez is show@@ ing that the old c@@ ry of “@@ Y@@ ank@@ e@@ e go hom@@ e” still res@@ on@@ at@@ es.
M@@ OS@@ CO@@ W@@ : The har@@ dest thing about power is know@@ ing when to let go@@ .
The next har@@ des@@ t, particularly in a country like Russia which has experienc@@ ed nothing but dictator@@ ship for a m@@ illenni@@ um, is know@@ ing whom to hand over power to@@ .
In announc@@ ing his res@@ ig@@ nation on Dec@@ ember 3@@ 1 B@@ or@@ is Y@@ el@@ t@@ sin may have succ@@ ee@@ ded on both coun@@ ts, ass@@ uring not only his personal saf@@ et@@ y, but his place in history and Russia's inf@@ ant democracy.
Y@@ el@@ t@@ sin was more than the man who sa@@ ved Russia in 1991 when a cou@@ p by communist har@@ d-@@ lin@@ ers threat@@ ened to turn back the clo@@ ck by n@@ ul@@ lif@@ ying Mik@@ ha@@ il Gor@@ b@@ ach@@ ev@@ 's per@@ est@@ ro@@ i@@ ka and g@@ las@@ no@@ st.
In n@@ ine mu@@ d@@ dy years since then Y@@ el@@ t@@ sin also created a new Russia, very much in his own ima@@ ge@@ : one un@@ predict@@ able, way@@ war@@ d, but full of promis@@ e.
By step@@ p@@ ing down now, Y@@ el@@ t@@ sin has given his hand@@ pi@@ ck@@ ed success@@ or, ac@@ ting president Vladimir Put@@ in, the best chance to win elections that will take place this coming Mar@@ ch.
S@@ ha@@ des of Kremlin ts@@ ars and com@@ miss@@ ars of old@@ ? As a de@@ ft man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ r@@ er of the old school of communist politic@@ s, the gi@@ be is temp@@ ting to app@@ ly to Y@@ el@@ ts@@ in.
It is also un@@ fair@@ . With mand@@ atory presidential elections next year, Mosco@@ w was aw@@ ash in ru@@ mo@@ ur@@ s: “@@ fe@@ ed@@ ing time at the zo@@ o@@ ” as one British prime minister called it.
By ending the wh@@ is@@ per@@ ing campaign that he inten@@ ded to cl@@ ing to power no matter wh@@ at, President Y@@ el@@ t@@ sin deser@@ ves more che@@ ers than je@@ ers.
Th@@ rou@@ gh this order@@ ly and constitu@@ tion@@ ally correc@@ t de@@ vice to attempt to ass@@ ure his succ@@ ession@@ , Y@@ el@@ t@@ sin may have put paid to any possibility of a cha@@ o@@ tic power struggle in the Kremlin without sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ing democratic principl@@ es.
Russia may now go on to complete its transition from commun@@ ism to capit@@ alism.
But what do we know of the h@@ eir appar@@ ent, Vladimir Putin@@ ?
In ke@@ eping with his sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ y K@@ G@@ B back@@ ground@@ , very litt@@ le.
Putin is a mar@@ ried 4@@ 6 year ol@@ d, and a gradu@@ ate of S@@ ain@@ t Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g Universi@@ t@@ y's La@@ w Fac@@ ul@@ ty.
St@@ ation@@ ed for a decade as a K@@ G@@ B ag@@ ent in the former East Germany, he saw Western democratic and business practi@@ ces at close hand, and is believed to be committed to them.
After commun@@ ism@@ 's collap@@ se, he worked with people like A@@ not@@ ol@@ y Ch@@ ub@@ a@@ is in the liberal S@@ t. Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g government of the early 1990@@ s.
Trans@@ fer@@ red to Mosco@@ w@@ , he he@@ aded the FS@@ B (the transform@@ ed K@@ G@@ B@@ ) until Y@@ el@@ t@@ sin sud@@ den@@ ly appoin@@ ted him prime minister last Au@@ gu@@ st.
Despite his mur@@ k@@ y profi@@ le, Putin@@ 's most po@@ tent claim to f@@ ame – and to power – is a d@@ our t@@ ough@@ n@@ ess.
In the blo@@ od@@ y moun@@ tains and ru@@ ined cities of Ch@@ echn@@ y@@ a, Putin established his cre@@ denti@@ als as the hard man Russia needs to restore order and stop the country's internal di@@ sin@@ tegration by re@@ vit@@ aliz@@ ing state power.
That the West seems ner@@ v@@ ous about Putin only enh@@ ances his pres@@ tige at hom@@ e.

With Western economic policy pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions widely seen as having failed in Russi@@ a@@ ; with NATO exp@@ anding near to the country's bor@@ ders and old allies like Serbi@@ a bom@@ bed@@ ; with America seen as wan@@ ting to weak@@ en Russia even mor@@ e, break@@ ing it up into pi@@ ec@@ es and controll@@ ing the o@@ il@@ -@@ rich C@@ as@@ pi@@ an bas@@ in, anti-@@ wes@@ tern senti@@ ments are on the ri@@ se.
President Putin@@ 's ke@@ en political an@@ ten@@ n@@ a has cau@@ ght this tren@@ d.
So the fact that the West ey@@ es Russia's ac@@ ting president with susp@@ ici@@ on makes him even more desi@@ ra@@ ble to the traditional Russian hear@@ t.
Vladimir Put@@ in, however, pre@@ f@@ ers to promote the im@@ pression of his being a more en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed and modern leader@@ .
His prime ministeri@@ al new year@@ 's address – "@@ Russia at the Tur@@ n of the Millenni@@ um@@ " -@@ - was post@@ ed on a Russian Govern@@ ment we@@ b@@ si@@ te for all the world to see before being publi@@ shed in Russian newspap@@ ers.
In it he out@@ lin@@ ed his presidential program@@ : pla@@ ying to the c@@ row@@ ds, he declared that Russia is no play@@ thing for the West to k@@ ick aro@@ und@@ .
But de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ er@@ y stopp@@ ed ther@@ e. Russia, he also decl@@ ar@@ ed, must men@@ d itself.
It will remain cooper@@ ative and friend@@ ly with the world, provided that the world is cooper@@ ative and friend@@ ly to@@ o.
But the hard work of re@@ building Russia must be done by Russi@@ ans, and with no time to wa@@ st@@ e.
In Russia cultural in@@ stinc@@ ts, in which commun@@ al ideas remain more valu@@ ed than individu@@ alist principl@@ es, help determin@@ e the success or failure of policies.
The national strategi@@ es Putin will likely follow will take into account these social imp@@ ul@@ ses.
Th@@ us he is unlikely to public@@ ly tru@@ m@@ pe@@ t the un@@ for@@ giving capit@@ alist policies of G@@ a@@ id@@ ar and Ch@@ ub@@ a@@ is, even if he qui@@ et@@ ly pursu@@ es them.
Un@@ doub@@ tedly a strong pat@@ rio@@ t, Putin also knows that Russia's national idea of itself must be cle@@ ans@@ ed of hau@@ gh@@ tin@@ ess and imperi@@ al ambi@@ tions.
Tim@@ e and again he has said that Russia's national idea must bl@@ end traditional Russian conc@@ ep@@ ts with a new@@ , modern con@@ t@@ ent.
The Russia he en@@ vi@@ sions will be a great power once mor@@ e, but great in the ways that a truly modern society must be@@ : in its democratic commit@@ ments, its economy, and its domestic tran@@ qu@@ illi@@ ty.
The consensus in Russia today is that Putin is a man of neither great tal@@ ents nor great vic@@ es.
To ordinary Russians he appears as mo@@ des@@ t, princip@@ le@@ d, and hon@@ est – a vast contra@@ st with the tain@@ ted politicians of the Y@@ el@@ t@@ sin years.
He is a perf@@ ect f@@ it for a Russia grow@@ n ti@@ red of the her@@ o@@ es, revolution@@ ari@@ es, crimin@@ als – even sa@@ vi@@ our@@ s – who make life exc@@ iting but r@@ ar@@ ely st@@ able.
A recent pol@@ l show@@ ed that what Russia most wants is a new Bre@@ z@@ h@@ ne@@ v@@ , whose 20 years (@@ 196@@ 4@@ -@@ 198@@ 2@@ ) of leadership first were dis@@ da@@ ined as an "@@ era of stag@@ nation@@ ," but are now no@@ stal@@ gi@@ cally rec@@ all@@ ed as the "@@ g@@ ol@@ den era of stag@@ nation@@ ."
Putin f@@ its the desi@@ red m@@ ould for a firm@@ ness and st@@ oli@@ di@@ ty that ensu@@ res stabilit@@ y, a strong state, and a "@@ g@@ ol@@ den m@@ idd@@ le@@ " between radical reforms and stron@@ g-@@ ar@@ m ru@@ le.
In the back of their min@@ ds, however, Russians also hold a secre@@ t fear about Putin@@ .
It concerns a man, a p@@ leas@@ ant qui@@ et individual who wal@@ ks so@@ und@@ less@@ ly through the Krem@@ lin@@ 's cor@@ ri@@ dor@@ s, some@@ one who un@@ comp@@ la@@ in@@ ingly takes on (and comple@@ tes@@ ) many hard and un@@ p@@ leas@@ ant t@@ as@@ ks neg@@ lec@@ ted by others who fight no@@ i@@ si@@ ly for high posi@@ tion.
Russians know that, one da@@ y, these un@@ assum@@ ing political be@@ ast@@ s of burden sud@@ den@@ ly come out on top@@ , as St@@ ali@@ n did in the early 19@@ 20@@ s.
So of President Putin Russia, like history, must still reser@@ ve its jud@@ ge@@ ment.
S@@ A@@ NA@@ A – When Y@@ em@@ en’s President Al@@ i Ab@@ dul@@ la@@ h Sal@@ e@@ h order@@ ed his military on Mar@@ ch 18 to fir@@ e on peaceful protes@@ ters call@@ ing for his res@@ ig@@ nation@@ , he se@@ aled his f@@ ate.
A wa@@ ve of milit@@ ary, government, and diplomatic def@@ ec@@ tions, led by his long-@@ time ally Fir@@ st Ar@@ mor@@ ed Bri@@ ga@@ de Com@@ man@@ der General Al@@ i Mu@@ h@@ sin al-@@ Ah@@ m@@ ar, ro@@ ck@@ ed his regi@@ me.
But, although al-@@ Ah@@ mar announced that he was app@@ all@@ ed by the use of force and vo@@ w@@ ed to def@@ end the constitu@@ tion, his decision was anything but al@@ tru@@ istic@@ .
The dis@@ gr@@ un@@ t@@ led gener@@ al, who has long-@@ standing ties to the type of ji@@ ha@@ di@@ sts that the United States is batt@@ ling in Y@@ em@@ en, merely sought to sett@@ le a s@@ core with the presid@@ ent@@ ’s fam@@ il@@ y.
The relationship between al-@@ Ah@@ mar and Sal@@ e@@ h exten@@ ds to their you@@ th, with Sal@@ eh@@ ’s mo@@ ther having had a second mar@@ ri@@ age to al-@@ Ah@@ mar@@ ’s un@@ cle@@ .
Th@@ ough they are not hal@@ f-@@ bro@@ ther@@ s, this frequ@@ ent, if mistak@@ en refer@@ ence, indic@@ ates their clo@@ sen@@ ess.
Al-@@ Ah@@ mar has long been considered either Sal@@ eh@@ ’s right hand man or the country’s h@@ id@@ den presid@@ ent. When the N@@ asser@@ ite party attemp@@ ted to over@@ th@@ row Sal@@ e@@ h less than 100 days into his presiden@@ cy, al-@@ Ah@@ mar def@@ ended him and qu@@ ash@@ ed the cou@@ p@@ .
In 199@@ 4, his un@@ its put down a sec@@ ession@@ ist movement in the sou@@ th.
But, as Sal@@ e@@ h prepared the way for his son Ah@@ ma@@ d – the head of the Pres@@ idential Gu@@ ard – to succe@@ ed him@@ , he began to margin@@ alize al-@@ Ah@@ mar@@ .
In 2009, Sal@@ e@@ h s@@ ack@@ ed al-@@ Ah@@ mar@@ ’s key back@@ ers, including Central Com@@ m@@ and Ch@@ ief General al-@@ Th@@ ah@@ ir@@ i al-@@ S@@ ha@@ d@@ ad@@ i and L@@ ie@@ ut@@ en@@ ant General Ha@@ y@@ d@@ ar al-@@ S@@ an@@ h@@ ani@@ , from power.
Al-@@ Ah@@ mar has also not benef@@ ited from the military aid that the US la@@ v@@ ished on Y@@ em@@ en in the w@@ ake of al-@@ Qaed@@ a’s failed Chri@@ st@@ m@@ as Da@@ y p@@ lot in 2009 to down an American air@@ lin@@ er.
While the Central Security Ser@@ vic@@ e, led by Sal@@ eh@@ ’s ne@@ p@@ he@@ w Y@@ ah@@ y@@ a, has received millions of dollars to fight al-@@ Qaed@@ a in the Arabi@@ an P@@ en@@ ins@@ ul@@ a, al-@@ Ah@@ mar has been left out of the economic b@@ on@@ anz@@ a.
At the same time, al-@@ Ah@@ mar@@ ’s dis@@ mal performance in sp@@ ear@@ head@@ ing the war against the H@@ ou@@ th@@ i-@@ led sec@@ t@@ arian re@@ bel@@ li@@ on in the nor@@ th made him a conven@@ i@@ ent sc@@ ap@@ e@@ go@@ at for the regi@@ me@@ ’s fail@@ ur@@ es.
The regi@@ me@@ ’s desire to get al-@@ Ah@@ mar out of the p@@ ic@@ ture became clear during the last round of fighting ag@@ in@@ st the H@@ ou@@ this in 200@@ 9@@ -@@ 201@@ 0, when Saudi Arabi@@ a began bom@@ bing the re@@ bel@@ s.
According to a US diplomatic c@@ able re@@ leas@@ ed by W@@ ik@@ i@@ Le@@ ak@@ s, Y@@ em@@ en@@ i officials gave the Saudi@@ s the coordin@@ ates for al-@@ Ah@@ mar@@ ’s comm@@ and cent@@ er, t@@ elling them that it was a H@@ ou@@ th@@ i camp@@ .
His relationship with Sal@@ e@@ h fra@@ yed and his influence wan@@ ing, al-@@ Ah@@ mar under@@ stood that his loy@@ al@@ ty to Sal@@ e@@ h had become a li@@ ability.
So his decision to aband@@ on Sal@@ e@@ h st@@ emm@@ ed less from his lo@@ ve of the constitu@@ tion and democracy than from his desire to even the s@@ core with the president and his son Ah@@ ma@@ d Sal@@ eh@@ , with whom he has long cl@@ ash@@ ed.
Their un@@ its sk@@ ir@@ mis@@ h@@ ed during the H@@ ou@@ th@@ i campaig@@ n, and the two eng@@ aged in a power struggle over defense of the radi@@ o and tel@@ evi@@ sion st@@ ations.
Sal@@ e@@ h won at the time, but today al-@@ Ah@@ mar@@ ’s troops have contro@@ l.
Al-@@ Ah@@ mar@@ ’s relationship with ji@@ ha@@ di@@ sts is a source of serious conc@@ ern.
He is mar@@ ried to the si@@ ster of T@@ ari@@ q al-@@ F@@ ad@@ h@@ li@@ , a Y@@ em@@ en@@ i who f@@ ought al@@ ong@@ side al-@@ Qaed@@ a leader O@@ sam@@ a bin La@@ di@@ n in Afghanist@@ an.
When more than 4@@ ,000 Ara@@ bs re@@ turned from fighting the Sovi@@ ets ther@@ e, al-@@ Ah@@ mar organiz@@ ed them into un@@ its and dep@@ loy@@ ed them in the 199@@ 4 civil war.
One ji@@ ha@@ di@@ st who tra@@ ined in al-@@ Qaed@@ a’s camp@@ s, and met bin L@@ ad@@ in, told me that upon his return from Afghanistan, he was inv@@ ited to meet al-@@ Ah@@ mar@@ ’s associ@@ ates and was given a month@@ ly sti@@ pen@@ d.
During a 1999 tri@@ al of Y@@ em@@ en@@ is con@@ vic@@ ted of k@@ id@@ n@@ app@@ ing 1@@ 6 Europe@@ ans, it emerg@@ ed that the group@@ ’s ring@@ leader called al-@@ Ah@@ mar during the or@@ de@@ al.
Th@@ ough his ties to ji@@ ha@@ di@@ sts may be ex@@ pe@@ di@@ ent rather than ideologi@@ c@@ al, they are deeply wor@@ r@@ y@@ ing.
Today, Sal@@ eh@@ ’s support among his top gener@@ als is d@@ win@@ d@@ l@@ ing.
Of Y@@ em@@ en’s four regional com@@ man@@ ders, only Sou@@ thern Com@@ m@@ and Ch@@ ief General Mah@@ di Ma@@ q@@ wal@@ a still back@@ s him@@ .
L@@ ess@@ er lie@@ ut@@ en@@ ant gener@@ als have deser@@ ted the president in dro@@ ves.
The f@@ ate of the country may not hin@@ ge on Sal@@ eh@@ , a cra@@ f@@ ty ve@@ ter@@ an who knows that his car@@ e@@ er is over@@ .
But his son Ah@@ ma@@ d, who is less politically ast@@ u@@ te, may yet seek to sett@@ le accoun@@ ts with al-@@ Ah@@ mar@@ .
His forces have already cl@@ ash@@ ed with ri@@ val un@@ its in Mu@@ k@@ all@@ a and sur@@ ro@@ unded the presidential pal@@ ace in A@@ den.
If the Sal@@ eh@@ s re@@ tain control of the air forc@@ e, which remains under the control of Sal@@ eh@@ ’s hal@@ f-@@ bro@@ ther, emp@@ lo@@ ying it against def@@ ec@@ ting military divi@@ sions would likely lead to a blo@@ od@@ b@@ a@@ th.
Nevertheless, the do@@ om@@ s@@ day scenari@@ os predic@@ ting an@@ arch@@ y and cha@@ os in the post-@@ Sal@@ e@@ h era are most likely ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated.
Un@@ like in Egyp@@ t, the v@@ ac@@ u@@ um resulting from Sal@@ eh@@ ’s de@@ par@@ ture can be quickly fil@@ le@@ d, so the country need not fall back on a military oli@@ g@@ arch@@ y.
The Y@@ em@@ en@@ i opposition is not only organiz@@ ed, but also pla@@ ys an active role in politics and has true gra@@ ss@@ roo@@ ts suppor@@ t.
And, un@@ like in Egyp@@ t, where the ruling party was de@@ test@@ ed and out of tou@@ ch with the mass@@ es, Y@@ em@@ en’s General Peop@@ le’s Congress has some following in society.
If Sal@@ e@@ h lea@@ ves peac@@ eful@@ ly and repres@@ ses the ur@@ ge to un@@ leas@@ h the last rema@@ ining loy@@ al army un@@ its against protes@@ ters and def@@ ec@@ ting soldi@@ ers, the country can aver@@ t Liby@@ a-@@ like ma@@ y@@ h@@ em@@ .
Indeed, the opposition parties have already organiz@@ ed a transi@@ tional coun@@ cil to take Sal@@ eh@@ ’s plac@@ e.
With the su@@ n quickly set@@ ting on the Sal@@ e@@ h er@@ a, the president is out of op@@ tions.
The only decision before him and his th@@ inn@@ ing ran@@ ks of allies is whether to leave peac@@ eful@@ ly or go down figh@@ t@@ ing.
For some time, scientists have believed that individual human bein@@ gs were 9@@ 9@@ .@@ 9@@ % gene@@ tic@@ ally iden@@ tic@@ al. The 0.@@ 1% of the gen@@ ome that was different (@@ appro@@ xim@@ ately 3,@@ 00@@ 0@@ ,000 bas@@ es of D@@ NA@@ ) was com@@ pri@@ sed of “@@ single nu@@ cle@@ o@@ ti@@ de pol@@ y@@ mor@@ ph@@ ism@@ s” (@@ S@@ N@@ P@@ s are al@@ ter@@ ations of the individual bas@@ es of D@@ NA@@ ) sc@@ at@@ tered throughout the genom@@ e.
It was thought that some of these D@@ N@@ A al@@ ter@@ ations may in part explain some of the physi@@ cal differences that ex@@ ist between two differ@@ ent, but other@@ wise normal individu@@ als.
In the sum@@ mer of 200@@ 4, two groups of scientists working in@@ depend@@ ently (@@ one led by resear@@ ch@@ ers at Harv@@ ard Medi@@ cal Scho@@ ol and Bri@@ g@@ ha@@ m and W@@ om@@ en’s Ho@@ spit@@ al in Bo@@ st@@ on and the other led by resear@@ ch@@ ers at Cold Sp@@ ring Har@@ b@@ or L@@ abor@@ at@@ ori@@ es@@ ) called this scientific do@@ g@@ ma into ques@@ tion.
Their research identi@@ fied hundreds of regions of the human gen@@ ome where the number of co@@ pi@@ es of a particular D@@ N@@ A se@@ g@@ ment vari@@ ed from individual to individu@@ al.
With only a few excep@@ tions, all D@@ N@@ A se@@ g@@ ments were thought to ex@@ ist in two co@@ pi@@ es (@@ one co@@ p@@ y inher@@ ited from your mo@@ ther and one co@@ p@@ y inher@@ ited from your fa@@ ther@@ ). 
Both stu@@ dies show@@ ed that there are hundreds of regions of the gen@@ ome that could have more or less than the expected two co@@ pi@@ es.
This al@@ er@@ ted scientists to the exist@@ ence of a larger source of genetic vari@@ ation than was pre@@ viously under@@ sto@@ od, and forced us to specul@@ ate on the implic@@ ations of this dis@@ cover@@ y.
This dis@@ co@@ very was made recently because until now, the technology was not available to compreh@@ ensi@@ vely ass@@ ess genom@@ ic im@@ balances in a genom@@ e-@@ wide fas@@ hi@@ on.
That has changed over the last five or six years, with the development of a techni@@ que known as “@@ ar@@ ra@@ y-@@ based compar@@ ative genom@@ ic hy@@ bri@@ di@@ z@@ ation@@ ” (@@ ar@@ ra@@ y-@@ C@@ G@@ H@@ ), revolution@@ iz@@ ing genetic research and diagno@@ sti@@ c@@ s.
Ab@@ out three years ago at Bri@@ g@@ ha@@ m and W@@ om@@ en’s Ho@@ spit@@ al, when we were seeking a potential to@@ ol for high-@@ res@@ olution diagno@@ sti@@ c@@ s, ar@@ ra@@ y-@@ C@@ G@@ H offered the hope of providing a reli@@ able and efficient genom@@ e-@@ wide test that could de@@ tec@@ t gains or losses in an un@@ bi@@ as@@ ed and non-@@ sub@@ jec@@ tive fas@@ hi@@ on.
When v@@ ali@@ d@@ ation experi@@ ments were per@@ form@@ ed that compared the D@@ N@@ A from one “@@ norm@@ al, health@@ y” individual with the D@@ N@@ A from another “@@ norm@@ al, health@@ y” individu@@ al, we were ast@@ on@@ ished to find an average of 12 D@@ N@@ A frag@@ ments that show@@ ed co@@ p@@ y number differences between the two individuals being compar@@ ed.
These became known as co@@ p@@ y number vari@@ ant@@ s, or C@@ N@@ V@@ s.
Com@@ bin@@ ing the data from our study and the study from Cold Sp@@ ring Har@@ b@@ or L@@ abor@@ at@@ ori@@ es, over 300 regions of the gen@@ ome were found to ex@@ hi@@ b@@ it C@@ N@@ V@@ s among normal individu@@ als.
Since these two ini@@ tial stu@@ dies, many other group@@ s, including our@@ s, have con@@ firm@@ ed and docum@@ ented many more C@@ N@@ V@@ s in other individuals stu@@ di@@ ed.
This is the goal of the Stru@@ c@@ tural Gen@@ om@@ ic V@@ ari@@ ation Con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um@@ ’s C@@ op@@ y N@@ um@@ ber V@@ ari@@ ation Pro@@ jec@@ t, which aim@@ s at providing resear@@ ch@@ ers the most comprehensive list and character@@ ization of C@@ N@@ V@@ s in human@@ s.
The Con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um recently ass@@ essed 2@@ 70 individuals from four popul@@ ations with anc@@ est@@ ry in Africa, Asia or Europe (@@ known as the H@@ ap@@ Ma@@ p collec@@ tion@@ ) to construc@@ t a new ma@@ p of the human genom@@ e.
U@@ sing two comple@@ ment@@ ary genom@@ e-@@ wide technologi@@ es, with sub@@ sequ@@ ent v@@ ali@@ d@@ ation stu@@ dies, a total of 1,@@ 4@@ 4@@ 7 C@@ N@@ V@@ s were identi@@ fi@@ ed. 
The data clearly demon@@ st@@ rate that individuals are not as gene@@ tic@@ ally similar as once though@@ t.
Many of the regions in which the C@@ N@@ V@@ s were identi@@ fied over@@ l@@ app@@ ed known disease gen@@ es.
Since they are being identi@@ fied in normal individu@@ als, C@@ N@@ V@@ s may not necess@@ arily be a direct cause of human diseas@@ e, but many may conf@@ er sus@@ c@@ ep@@ ti@@ bility to certain diseas@@ es, serve as disease mark@@ ers, and@@ /@@ or indic@@ ate potential regions of genom@@ ic inst@@ ability.
Some C@@ N@@ V@@ s are also associated with gen@@ es involved in im@@ mun@@ e response and de@@ to@@ xi@@ fic@@ ation@@ -@@ related met@@ ab@@ oli@@ sm (@@ some of the human bo@@ d@@ y’s re@@ actions to the environment that we live in@@ ).
Indeed, some C@@ N@@ V@@ s may turn out to explain why some people re@@ act differ@@ ently to specific medic@@ ations.
H@@ op@@ eful@@ ly, a more comprehensive understanding of human genetic vari@@ ation (@@ i@@ .@@ e. single b@@ ase pa@@ ir changes and structural genom@@ ic vari@@ ation, such as C@@ N@@ V@@ s) will ultimately help physi@@ ci@@ ans to pres@@ cri@@ be medic@@ ation in a more individu@@ alized man@@ n@@ er, that would result in ma@@ xim@@ um therap@@ eu@@ tic effects to each pati@@ ent, with minim@@ al side effec@@ ts.
O@@ ver@@ all, we anti@@ cip@@ ate that many of these C@@ N@@ V@@ s will provide explan@@ ations to how we adap@@ t and inter@@ act with our ever@@ -@@ changing environ@@ ment.
Indeed, as stu@@ dies continue to identi@@ fy and charac@@ teri@@ ze C@@ N@@ V@@ s, we anti@@ cip@@ ate achiev@@ ing a better understanding of the relationship between these genetic vari@@ ations, complex diseas@@ es, and human adap@@ t@@ ability.
J@@ ust as famili@@ arity bre@@ eds con@@ temp@@ t, success often sp@@ aw@@ ns com@@ plac@@ enc@@ y.
Sad@@ ly, that seems to be the case in Russia, where the government has cho@@ sen the first period of pro@@ lon@@ ged economic growth since commun@@ ism@@ 's fall@@ --@@ with the budget in surplus and capital f@@ light seem@@ ingly re@@ vers@@ ed@@ --@@ to re-@@ open the oli@@ gar@@ ch wars of the 1990@@ '@@ s.
Op@@ tim@@ ists be@@ war@@ e: the ar@@ rest of Mik@@ ha@@ il K@@ ho@@ dor@@ ko@@ v@@ sk@@ y-@@ -@@ and the fre@@ e@@ zing of his shar@@ es in oil gi@@ ant Yu@@ ko@@ s@@ --@@ will have a pro@@ found long-term impact on Russia's economy and on relations between business and government.
The Yu@@ ko@@ s im@@ bro@@ g@@ li@@ o will not bring Russia's economy to a s@@ cre@@ ech@@ ing hal@@ t, because no single company determin@@ es the country's f@@ ate. But long-term prospec@@ ts are certain to deter@@ i@@ or@@ ate.
The problem is one of trust between the business community and the government, which in recent years had just be@@ gu@@ n to develop@@ .
To put it bl@@ un@@ t@@ ly, viol@@ ating that f@@ led@@ gl@@ ing trust will break the back of Russia's economic up@@ s@@ w@@ ing.
"@@ Oper@@ ation C@@ le@@ an Hand@@ s@@ "@@ --@@ what some are call@@ ing the investig@@ ations into K@@ ho@@ dor@@ ko@@ v@@ sk@@ y and his associ@@ at@@ es@@ --@@ will not increase tax revenu@@ e, but only sp@@ ur growth in the inform@@ al economy, as business@@ men try to conc@@ e@@ al their affair@@ s even more comple@@ tel@@ y from the government.
After all, once Russia's rich@@ est man can be stri@@ pped of his assets at any mom@@ ent, ordinary Russian business@@ men may be for@@ given for conclu@@ ding that oper@@ ating in the open is risk@@ y.
The first sig@@ ns of this re@@ alization will probably take the form of an increase in capital f@@ ligh@@ t.
Un@@ til the Yu@@ ko@@ s affair@@ , capital f@@ light was re@@ vers@@ ing.
After a decade of h@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ging capit@@ al, the first half of this year saw data indic@@ ating that Russians who had taken their money out of the country were bringing it back to invest at hom@@ e.
If capital f@@ light res@@ um@@ es, it will quickly s@@ now@@ ball if President Putin fail@@ s to con@@ vin@@ ce people that the Yu@@ ko@@ s aff@@ air is an isol@@ ated cas@@ e.
I believe that capital f@@ light will increase substanti@@ ally.
R@@ educ@@ ed business activ@@ ity, with long-term investment projects being canc@@ el@@ le@@ d, seems just as certain@@ .
A lower rate of economic growth thus seems inevit@@ able.
Nor am I al@@ one.
In@@ dependent Russian economic exper@@ ts are un@@ anim@@ ous in shar@@ ing this gri@@ m conclu@@ sion.
Only people lin@@ ked to the regime appear to differ@@ .
If investment st@@ all@@ s, President Putin will have no hope of dou@@ bl@@ ing the size of the economy within a deca@@ de, as he has promis@@ ed.
M@@ y lon@@ g@@ standing skep@@ tic@@ ism about this promise has now har@@ den@@ ed into certain@@ ty@@ : the Yu@@ ko@@ s aff@@ air will make it impossible to su@@ sta@@ in the growth rate required to achieve this goal because the ar@@ rest of Mik@@ ha@@ il K@@ ho@@ dor@@ ko@@ v@@ sk@@ y and the sei@@ z@@ ure of his assets has de@@ alt a dev@@ a@@ stat@@ ing b@@ low to business confi@@ dence.
Indeed, times have changed dramati@@ cally since the cut@@ th@@ ro@@ at Russian capitalism of the 1990@@ '@@ s@@ --@@ sup@@ pos@@ edly a world in which entrep@@ rene@@ urs were in@@ differ@@ ent, at bes@@ t, to each other@@ 's problems.
That car@@ ic@@ at@@ u@@ re, if ever tru@@ e, is certainly not true toda@@ y: the business commun@@ it@@ y's negative re@@ action to the per@@ secu@@ tion of K@@ ho@@ dor@@ ko@@ v@@ sk@@ y by the law en@@ forc@@ ement agen@@ cies has been strong and nearly un@@ ani@@ mo@@ us.
The growing calls of some state officials to deal with economic cri@@ me are viewed by the business community as both a mo@@ ck@@ er@@ y of the legal co@@ de and a v@@ ei@@ led threat that the pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ors want their cut of Russia's rich@@ es.
The improved ima@@ ge of Russia's legal system is in t@@ at@@ ters.
Today, the business community under@@ stands that the Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ or General@@ 's Off@@ ice can find any pre@@ text to go after any one of them.
If pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ors can tre@@ at huge busin@@ esses so rough@@ ly, what hope is there for medi@@ um and small business@@ es?
No surpri@@ se, then, that ow@@ ners of companies of all si@@ zes are now form@@ ing a un@@ ited fron@@ t to protect their interest@@ s.
President Put@@ in, mean@@ while, ste@@ ad@@ fa@@ stly ref@@ uses to disc@@ uss the Yu@@ ko@@ s aff@@ air or the actions of the law en@@ forc@@ ement agen@@ cies with Russia's business commun@@ ity.
His sil@@ ence clearly implies con@@ sent to the actions of the pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ or@@ s.
But if the president will not public@@ ly account for the fi@@ deli@@ ty of Russia's law en@@ forc@@ ement agen@@ cies to law, who will@@ ?
One of the great f@@ laws of Putin@@ 's presiden@@ cy has been to allow law en@@ forc@@ ement agen@@ cies to ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate their own ac@@ tions.
Of course, they inv@@ ari@@ ably conclu@@ de that their actions were right and law@@ ful@@ .
So the presid@@ ent@@ 's position is clear and he will not back dow@@ n.
In fact, only bus@@ ines@@ spe@@ op@@ le may now be able to influence event@@ s: a sharp and p@@ ron@@ oun@@ c@@ ed slow@@ dow@@ n, with Russian capital show@@ ing its disp@@ leas@@ ure by vo@@ ting with its fe@@ et, might be the last hope for tur@@ ning the pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ors from their cho@@ sen cour@@ se.
But I see no reason for optim@@ ism.
On the contrary, the ar@@ rest of K@@ ho@@ dor@@ ko@@ v@@ sk@@ y has only wh@@ et@@ ted the pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ or@@ s@@ ' appe@@ ti@@ te.
On@@ ce they have dig@@ est@@ ed Yu@@ ko@@ s, they will look for another me@@ al.
After that, can anyone seri@@ ously doubt that the cra@@ ving for f@@ res@@ h pre@@ y will intensi@@ f@@ y?
As China's new leadership te@@ am emer@@ ges, the world's attention has focused on President Ji@@ ang Z@@ emin@@ 's success@@ or.
But this is mis@@ gu@@ ide@@ d, for perhaps the most significant moment in China's recent history of boom and transform@@ ation was the 1998 appoin@@ t@@ ment of Z@@ h@@ u R@@ ong@@ j@@ i (@@ p@@ ron@@ oun@@ c@@ ed "@@ J@@ o@@ o R@@ on@@ g-@@ je@@ e@@ "@@ ) as pre@@ mi@@ er of the State Counc@@ il, a position once held by Den@@ g X@@ ia@@ op@@ ing.
Given the obvious importance of the po@@ st in recent years, the choice of M@@ r@@ . Z@@ hu@@ 's re@@ plac@@ ement may be of even more signific@@ ance than President Ji@@ ang@@ 's de@@ par@@ ture from center sta@@ ge.
Even before he became pre@@ mier@@ , M@@ r@@ . Z@@ hu@@ , as the president of China's central bank@@ , was known as the arch@@ it@@ ect of China's 8% annual economic growth in the 1990@@ s and the ma@@ ster@@ min@@ d of its successful fight against infl@@ ation.
M@@ r@@ . Z@@ h@@ u has been China's J@@ ack Wel@@ ch, the t@@ ough@@ -@@ min@@ ded, lon@@ g@@ time CE@@ O of the American con@@ gl@@ om@@ er@@ ate General E@@ lec@@ tric@@ --@@ a man cel@@ eb@@ rated for his c@@ and@@ or, his global s@@ op@@ h@@ istic@@ ation, and his insi@@ st@@ ence on performan@@ ce.
Indeed, M@@ r@@ . Z@@ h@@ u was ren@@ owned for pun@@ ish@@ ing those who fell short of his expect@@ ations.
As ma@@ y@@ or of Sh@@ ang@@ ha@@ i, he once discipl@@ ined his tou@@ ri@@ st bu@@ re@@ au officials by making them sc@@ ru@@ b the c@@ it@@ y's public to@@ i@@ le@@ ts themsel@@ ves.
A few months after his appoin@@ t@@ ment as pre@@ mier@@ , M@@ r@@ . Z@@ h@@ u deliver@@ ed his "@@ three promis@@ es@@ " spe@@ ech@@ , in which he p@@ led@@ ged to make three b@@ old mo@@ ves to secure a more vi@@ bran@@ t, self-@@ sustain@@ ing economy.
First, he would over@@ hau@@ l the 3@@ 00@@ ,000 state-@@ run national corpor@@ ations that still conduc@@ ted an overwhelm@@ ing amount of China's business and accoun@@ ted for the bul@@ k of its economic activ@@ ity.
More than 7@@ 0% of such companies were un@@ profit@@ able and were pro@@ pped up by government sub@@ sid@@ y.
J@@ ust as M@@ r@@ . Wel@@ ch promised to "@@ fix@@ , clos@@ e, or s@@ ell@@ " non@@ per@@ form@@ ing divi@@ sions of General E@@ lec@@ tri@@ c when he took over the comp@@ an@@ y, M@@ r@@ . Z@@ h@@ u threat@@ ened to fir@@ e ch@@ ief execu@@ tives of Chinese firms that lost money for more than two con@@ secu@@ tive years, and then either to sh@@ ut them down or sell them.
This forced national corpor@@ ations to be privati@@ zed and go public or to be over@@ seen by pro@@ vin@@ cial government@@ s, a change that pro@@ ved to be a major imp@@ et@@ us for a sud@@ den de@@ cent@@ rali@@ zation of China's governance structu@@ re@@ --@@ another key leg@@ acy of M@@ r@@ . Z@@ hu@@ 's ten@@ u@@ re.
Second, M@@ r@@ . Z@@ h@@ u said he would wi@@ pe out the many bad deb@@ ts of China's banks and "@@ international trust compani@@ es@@ ."
Many of these had contribut@@ ed to a so@@ f@@ ten@@ ing in China's economy by ro@@ ut@@ in@@ ely lending money to in@@ solv@@ ent corpor@@ ations.
At the time, there were 2@@ 4@@ 5 such trust compani@@ es, which had such a poor record of re@@ pay@@ ment that over@@ se@@ as investors were beginning to sh@@ u@@ n China enti@@ rel@@ y.
Reform@@ ing them would take 10 years, he sa@@ i@@ d.
Thir@@ d, M@@ r@@ . Z@@ h@@ u said he would stre@@ am@@ line the central government and take on one of China's most per@@ ni@@ ci@@ ous problem@@ s: high-@@ level corruption in government agen@@ cies.
He would pro@@ pose measures inclu@@ d@@ ing, for example, cutting lin@@ ks between government and organiz@@ ed cri@@ me, and making it more difficult for bureauc@@ rats to accept bri@@ bes@@ .
Politi@@ ci@@ ans often make b@@ old promises but r@@ ar@@ ely keep them.
On Ju@@ ly 1, 2001, at the cel@@ eb@@ ration of the 8@@ 0@@ th anni@@ vers@@ ary of the Chinese Communist Par@@ ty, M@@ r@@ . Z@@ h@@ u ass@@ essed his progres@@ s.
His app@@ rais@@ al of his record in office is not@@ ably ac@@ cur@@ ate, and stands as a convinc@@ ing test@@ ament to the effec@@ tiveness of his leader@@ ship.
M@@ r@@ . Z@@ h@@ u told the ass@@ emb@@ led Communist leadership that he had ful@@ fill@@ ed the first promis@@ e: many of China's public corpor@@ ations had become profit@@ able private enti@@ ties or had been sh@@ ut dow@@ n.
Those that were still oper@@ ating were given st@@ ring@@ ent profit@@ ability targe@@ ts, were allowed to choose the people they hi@@ re@@ d, and were encoura@@ ged to raise money on private stock exchan@@ ges, which effectively pro@@ p@@ ell@@ ed them into the private sector as "@@ red chi@@ p@@ " corpor@@ ations.
As for the second promis@@ e, more than 50 head@@ s of financial institutions had at that point been fi@@ red (@@ more follow@@ ed@@ ), and reforms had changed the investment climate dramati@@ call@@ y.
Inste@@ ad of f@@ le@@ eing the country, capital was flow@@ ing in more rapidly than ever befor@@ e.
M@@ r@@ . Z@@ hu@@ 's record concern@@ ing his third promise was more mi@@ x@@ ed.
While the size of the central government fell dramati@@ call@@ y, with employment at the State Council hal@@ ved from 3@@ 4@@ ,000 to 17@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0, corruption continued to fes@@ ter.
Despite M@@ r@@ . Z@@ hu@@ 's effor@@ ts, opposition from v@@ est@@ ed interests throughout the government@@ --@@ particularly at the highest level@@ s@@ --@@ im@@ pe@@ ded reform@@ .
N@@ on@@ eth@@ eless, Z@@ h@@ u R@@ ong@@ ji@@ 's reforms created the kind of level pla@@ ying fiel@@ d and rule of law on which a vi@@ b@@ rant capit@@ alist system depend@@ s.
That is a political leg@@ acy second to n@@ one in modern Chinese histor@@ y.
As the world roo@@ ted for former United Nations Secretary General K@@ of@@ i Ann@@ an in his recent efforts to end the violence in Ken@@ y@@ a, many also found themselves won@@ der@@ ing whether a we@@ ary Ann@@ an, or some other global lea@@ der, will be batt@@ ling another fir@@ e by the end of this month@@ : this time in Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we@@ .
Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we@@ ’s up@@ coming elec@@ tions, sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed for Mar@@ ch 2@@ 9, offer both fear and hope to the millions tra@@ pped in or trying to es@@ cap@@ e the country’s hel@@ li@@ sh condi@@ tions.
Even official data now put the inflation rate at more than 100@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ %, and the p@@ light of ordinary Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we@@ ans grow@@ s more des@@ per@@ ate by the da@@ y.
The elections could bring Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we@@ ans a chance to end the long dictator@@ ship of President Robert Mu@@ ga@@ be.
But, without super@@ vi@@ sion, they will be held in an environment that could das@@ h Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we@@ an@@ s’ hop@@ es.
Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we@@ ans are den@@ ied their basic freedom@@ s and sub@@ jec@@ ted to viol@@ ence.
T@@ or@@ ture is widespre@@ ad.
C@@ i@@ vi@@ l society groups report the ar@@ res@@ ts of opposition electoral candid@@ at@@ es, the manipul@@ ation of food supp@@ lies for political pur@@ pos@@ es, and violent inci@@ d@@ ents of vo@@ ter in@@ tim@@ id@@ ation.
The Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we E@@ lec@@ tion S@@ up@@ port Net@@ work has also ex@@ pressed concern about the country’s state of read@@ iness for this complex elec@@ tion, which will comb@@ ine pres@@ identi@@ al, parliament@@ ary, sen@@ at@@ ori@@ al, and local government con@@ test@@ s.
And this is to say nothing of the structural f@@ aul@@ ts that continue to im@@ pe@@ de political progress – a def@@ ec@@ tive constitu@@ tion, c@@ ens@@ or@@ ed medi@@ a, and a parti@@ s@@ an security and military establish@@ ment.
It did@@ n’t have to be this way.
This past year has seen one mis@@ sed opportunity after an@@ other.
South African president Th@@ ab@@ o M@@ bek@@ i conven@@ ed negotiations with Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we@@ ’s political group@@ s; but they have been so un@@ fru@@ it@@ ful that opposition leaders recently all but acc@@ used M@@ bek@@ i of lying to the world about the progress of the tal@@ k@@ s.
Some African leaders – not@@ ably G@@ han@@ a’s president, John Ku@@ fu@@ or, and out@@ going African Union head Al@@ ph@@ a Kon@@ are – have tried to c@@ a@@ j@@ ol@@ e Mu@@ gabe towards reform@@ , to no avail@@ .
Perhaps more signific@@ antly, the international commun@@ it@@ y’s failure to address Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we seri@@ ously show@@ s, once again, that it lack@@ s the political will to prevent for@@ es@@ ee@@ able cri@@ ses.
Last year, UN Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i-@@ mo@@ on and UN H@@ ig@@ h Commission@@ er for Hum@@ an R@@ igh@@ ts L@@ ou@@ ise Ar@@ b@@ our condem@@ ned the regi@@ me@@ ’s use of tor@@ ture and its mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment of pro-@@ democracy forc@@ es.
Re@@ gre@@ tt@@ ab@@ ly, the UN failed to follow up with institutional ac@@ tion.
The UN would say it must be inv@@ ited into a country before it can take certain forms of ac@@ tion, such as sen@@ ding official election obser@@ ver@@ s.
But it is also true that with adequate political will, the UN Security Council could live up to its responsibility to Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we@@ ans by respon@@ ding to the crisis more aggressi@@ vel@@ y.
The UN should have put Mu@@ gabe on the def@@ ensive with a forc@@ eful public offer to help Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we pre@@ p@@ are for internation@@ ally super@@ vis@@ ed elec@@ tions.
Instead, the UN continues to def@@ er to Mu@@ ga@@ be, who hi@@ des behind claims of sovereign@@ ty while j@@ ail@@ ing a def@@ en@@ sel@@ ess popul@@ ac@@ e.
With so many lives at stak@@ e, what can be done to aver@@ t an intensi@@ fication of the Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we crisi@@ s?
People of good will throughout the world, including those aff@@ ili@@ ated with multilateral organizations like the UN@@ , should des@@ c@@ end on Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we to ob@@ serve this month@@ ’s elec@@ tions.
Ac@@ credi@@ ted or not, they should stand in solidar@@ ity with the people of Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we at this crucial mom@@ ent, act as witn@@ esses to the deter@@ i@@ or@@ ating pre-@@ election environ@@ ment, and serve as a bul@@ war@@ k against any es@@ cal@@ ation of state bru@@ t@@ ality during and after the vo@@ te.
Mu@@ gabe would pre@@ fer to limit the presence of international obser@@ vers to those sent by neighbor@@ ing states – the same allies that som@@ eh@@ ow managed to de@@ em the violent and f@@ rau@@ dul@@ ent elections of the past se@@ ven years “@@ legitim@@ at@@ e.”
Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we@@ ’s neighbor@@ s also face a choic@@ e: they can use their pro@@ xim@@ ity to halt Mu@@ ga@@ be@@ ’s ab@@ us@@ es, or to sh@@ iel@@ d him from international sc@@ ru@@ tin@@ y and re@@ bu@@ k@@ e.
Their choice may depend on what the world demands of them.
The people of Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we will play their part on Mar@@ ch 2@@ 9.
As for the regional and world commun@@ ity, their actions today and in the coming week@@ s could make the difference between a re@@ pri@@ se of the violence in Ken@@ y@@ a and the first step towards a more stable and democratic future.

J@@ O@@ H@@ AN@@ NE@@ S@@ B@@ U@@ R@@ G – Last week@@ , the United States Su@@ pre@@ me Court rul@@ ed that de@@ tain@@ e@@ es at Gu@@ ant@@ á@@ nam@@ o B@@ ay have the right to ha@@ be@@ as cor@@ p@@ us – the right to challenge the fac@@ tual and legal basis of their de@@ ten@@ tion in a cour@@ t of law@@ . @@ I was el@@ ated by the deci@@ sion, having spent four years working on ens@@ uring the rule of law in US de@@ ten@@ tion and inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation policy, including monit@@ or@@ ing military com@@ mission tri@@ als at Gu@@ ant@@ á@@ nam@@ o B@@ ay@@ . @@ But my happ@@ iness is tem@@ per@@ ed by where I si@@ t, close to the border with Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we – a country where the wri@@ t of ha@@ be@@ as cor@@ p@@ us and the rule of law have become ob@@ sol@@ e@@ te@@ . 
Ha@@ be@@ as cor@@ p@@ us, Latin for “@@ you have the bo@@ dy@@ ,” is an old Engli@@ sh common law principle in@@ corpor@@ ated into the US Constitu@@ tion to ensure freedom from un@@ law@@ ful de@@ ten@@ tion by the state.
It was and continues to be a critical ch@@ ec@@ k against the im@@ prison@@ ment of individuals without over@@ si@@ ght by independent cour@@ ts.
In Z@@ im@@ bab@@ w@@ e, this right – like so many other ch@@ ec@@ ks and balances – has been tor@@ n away by a repres@@ sive state.
J@@ ust ho@@ urs before the US Su@@ pre@@ me Court rul@@ ing, T@@ en@@ da@@ i Bi@@ ti@@ , the Sec@@ re@@ tar@@ y-@@ General of the opposition Mo@@ vement for Democratic Ch@@ ange (@@ M@@ D@@ C@@ ), was ar@@ res@@ ted upon his return to Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we@@ .
Despite immediate attemp@@ ts by his law@@ y@@ ers to loc@@ ate him@@ , his wher@@ e@@ ab@@ ou@@ ts remained unk@@ now@@ n for da@@ y@@ s.
The polic@@ e@@  @@ dis@@ mis@@ sed an ini@@ tial cour@@ t@@  @@ order dem@@ anding that B@@ it@@ i be produced before the cour@@ t.
After B@@ it@@ i was finally produced before the cour@@ t days later, the government announced that he will be charg@@ ed with tre@@ as@@ on – which car@@ ries the death pen@@ al@@ ty – for un@@ offici@@ ally announc@@ ing the results of the Mar@@ ch 2@@ 9, 2008, elec@@ tions@@ .  Pri@@ or to his de@@ ten@@ tion, B@@ it@@ i had respon@@ ded to such al@@ leg@@ ations by stat@@ ing that his only cri@@ me was to fight for democracy in Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we@@ .
It is unlikely that he will be able to challenge the basis of his de@@ ten@@ tion in an independent cour@@ t.
Since 199@@ 9, the M@@ D@@ C has offered a democratic alternative to President Robert Mu@@ ga@@ be@@ ’s regi@@ me.
In the most recent elec@@ tions, Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we@@ ans made their choice know@@ n, despite serious ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les and widespread repres@@ sion, with the M@@ D@@ C@@ ’s presidential candid@@ ate, Mor@@ g@@ an T@@ s@@ v@@ an@@ gi@@ ra@@ i, gain@@ ing more vo@@ tes than Mu@@ ga@@ be.
But, according to the vote coun@@ ts re@@ leas@@ ed by the government after a susp@@ ici@@ ous month@@ -@@ long del@@ a@@ y, the M@@ D@@ C@@ ’s marg@@ in of victory – 4@@ 8% to 4@@ 3% – fell short of the 50% required to avoid a run@@ -@@ off elec@@ tion@@ . 
B@@ it@@ i is not the only M@@ D@@ C member to be “@@ dis@@ appear@@ ed@@ ” for a period of time by Mu@@ ga@@ be@@ ’s government.
O@@ ver the past two years, police and government@@ -@@ supported par@@ am@@ ilit@@ aries have ro@@ ut@@ in@@ ely j@@ ai@@ le@@ d, be@@ aten, and even killed M@@ D@@ C officials and susp@@ ec@@ ted M@@ D@@ C member@@ s.
Last year, B@@ it@@ i was de@@ tain@@ ed and be@@ aten along with T@@ s@@ v@@ an@@ gi@@ ra@@ i and do@@ z@@ ens of other M@@ D@@ C offici@@ als.
The p@@ ho@@ to@@ s of T@@ s@@ v@@ an@@ gi@@ ra@@ i@@ ’s p@@ um@@ mel@@ ed body led to an international out@@ c@@ r@@ y.
Stat@@ e-@@ sp@@ on@@ sor@@ ed violence against the M@@ D@@ C and its suppor@@ ters has es@@ cal@@ ated as the Jun@@ e 2@@ 7 run@@ -@@ off vote dra@@ ws ne@@ ar@@ . @@ J@@ ust week@@ s ago, B@@ it@@ i descri@@ bed the dis@@ co@@ very of the mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ated body of T@@ on@@ der@@ ai N@@ di@@ ra@@ , an M@@ D@@ C you@@ th leader@@ .
N@@ di@@ ra had been taken by the police from his hom@@ e.
He was mis@@ sing for se@@ ven da@@ y@@ s; when his body was found@@ , it was recogni@@ z@@ able only by a b@@ rac@@ el@@ et he always wor@@ e@@ . 
H@@ ere in our offic@@ es in J@@ oh@@ ann@@ es@@ bur@@ g, we have two Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we@@ an law@@ y@@ ers who fl@@ ed their country after recei@@ ving death threats for their work def@@ ending human righ@@ ts.
At least five of their cli@@ ents have been mur@@ der@@ ed in the past few week@@ s.
Most rec@@ ently, the Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we@@ an police sus@@ pen@@ ded the work of num@@ er@@ ous human rights organizations that were docum@@ enting the recent viol@@ ence.
It is hard to imag@@ ine that a free and fair election can take place against the back@@ dro@@ p of such inten@@ se and system@@ ic viol@@ ence.
Indeed, even South African president Th@@ ab@@ o M@@ bek@@ i, wh@@ o, despite an out@@ c@@ ry from many of his citiz@@ ens, has supported Mu@@ ga@@ be, fel@@ t comp@@ ell@@ ed to la@@ bel it a “@@ cause for serious concern@@ .”
In the majority opinion in B@@ ou@@ medi@@ ene v@@ . Bush , Justi@@ ce An@@ th@@ ony Kenn@@ ed@@ y w@@ ro@@ te that “@@ Liber@@ ty and security can be re@@ con@@ ci@@ led@@ ; and in our system they are re@@ conc@@ il@@ ed within the framework of the law@@ .” But there is no rule of law left in Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we – no ha@@ be@@ as cor@@ p@@ us and no ch@@ ec@@ k on ar@@ bit@@ r@@ ary state ac@@ tion.
It is time for the international community to step in, call for an end to the de@@ ten@@ tion and dis@@ appear@@ ance of M@@ D@@ C officials and perceived suppor@@ ters, and push for a democratic transition in Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we@@ .
Only then can the principles underlying the Su@@ pre@@ me Cour@@ t’s decision come within reach of ordinary Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we@@ ans.
J@@ O@@ H@@ AN@@ NE@@ S@@ B@@ U@@ R@@ G – Mor@@ g@@ an T@@ s@@ v@@ an@@ gi@@ ra@@ i@@ ’s withdraw@@ al from the presidential run@@ -@@ off sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed for Jun@@ e 2@@ 7, and his decision to seek the protection of the D@@ ut@@ ch emb@@ ass@@ y in Pre@@ tori@@ a, has secu@@ red for Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we@@ ’s President Robert Mu@@ gabe a P@@ y@@ r@@ r@@ h@@ ic vic@@ tor@@ y.
Mu@@ ga@@ be@@ ’s tri@@ ump@@ h comes at a huge cost to democracy and stability in Z@@ im@@ bab@@ w@@ e, as well as in the region.
The actions of the Mu@@ gabe regime in the run@@ -@@ up to T@@ s@@ v@@ an@@ gi@@ ra@@ i@@ ’s decision demand a strong regional response to what is clearly a st@@ ol@@ en vic@@ tor@@ y. Indeed, Mu@@ ga@@ be@@ ’s continuing in power repres@@ ents the most serious challenge to Afric@@ a’s n@@ as@@ cent democratic institutions and to South Afric@@ a’s vision of a contin@@ ent of peace and prosper@@ ity.
After con@@ test@@ ing every election since 200@@ 0, T@@ s@@ v@@ an@@ gi@@ ra@@ i@@ ’s Mo@@ vement for Democratic Ch@@ ange (@@ M@@ D@@ C@@ ) has changed tac@@ tics rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ant@@ ly.
Un@@ der the circum@@ st@@ ances, South Africa and the Sou@@ thern African Development Commun@@ ity (@@ S@@ A@@ D@@ C@@ ) urg@@ ently need to re@@ app@@ raise their approach not only to Mu@@ ga@@ be, but to how they will deal with any un@@ con@@ test@@ ed elec@@ tion.
A ho@@ st of decl@@ ar@@ ations adopted over the years by the S@@ A@@ D@@ C and the African Union address the conduc@@ t of elections on the contin@@ ent.
These include the S@@ A@@ D@@ C Prin@@ cipl@@ es and Gu@@ id@@ el@@ ines Govern@@ ing Democratic E@@ lec@@ tions (@@ 200@@ 4@@ ), the African Char@@ ter on Democ@@ rac@@ y, E@@ lec@@ tions, and Govern@@ ance (@@ 200@@ 7@@ ), and the Dec@@ lar@@ ation on the Prin@@ cipl@@ es Govern@@ ing Democratic E@@ lec@@ tions in Africa (@@ 200@@ 2@@ ).
N@@ one of these principles have been respec@@ ted in Z@@ im@@ bab@@ w@@ e, and regional leaders have not c@@ ited their viol@@ ation as reason to c@@ ensure Mu@@ ga@@ be@@ ’s government@@ . 
Unfortunately, we have a recent preced@@ ent for this type of behavi@@ or@@ : Ken@@ y@@ a’s rul@@ ers, too, ignor@@ ed and t@@ wi@@ sted the rule of law and the integri@@ ty of the electoral proc@@ ess, rel@@ ying on violence to secure a political outcome that their fel@@ low citizens den@@ ied them.
De@@ aling effectively with political inst@@ ability in Africa requires two th@@ ing@@ s: the political will of key states to under@@ wri@@ te the democratic proc@@ ess, and strong regional institutions to provide a legal framework reflec@@ ting the principles under@@ p@@ inn@@ ing stat@@ es’ behavi@@ or. The effec@@ tiveness of regional institutions and the role of regional powers are inter@@ lin@@ k@@ ed.
Region@@ al institutions can ent@@ ren@@ ch themselves only if their members promote ad@@ her@@ ence to the spiri@@ t and let@@ ter of their legal frame@@ work@@ s.
In both cas@@ es, South Africa – the main regional power with the most le@@ vers of influence over Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we – has a vital role to pla@@ y.
But does South Africa really see itself as a regional power@@ ?
Its handl@@ ing of Mu@@ gabe over the past ei@@ ght years has actually under@@ played its lever@@ age.
Yet the man@@ t@@ le of a regional power sometimes requires using that lever@@ age for the greater good of the region.
What should South Africa do now@@ ?
Sh@@ ould President Th@@ ab@@ o M@@ bek@@ i step down as medi@@ ator in the Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we crisis, not because he has fai@@ le@@ d, but to re@@ move from South Africa the constra@@ in@@ ts that being a medi@@ ator put in plac@@ e?
South Africa has a v@@ est@@ ed interest in stabilit@@ y, and it can turn the s@@ cre@@ ws on Mu@@ ga@@ be@@ ’s regi@@ me, much as it has ref@@ used to con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ate any form of sanctions because of their impact on the poor@@ .
South Africa must ta@@ p into the growing concern among Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we@@ ’s neighbor@@ s (@@ Ang@@ ol@@ a, Bo@@ ts@@ wan@@ a, T@@ anz@@ ani@@ a, and Z@@ ambi@@ a@@ ) about the political crisis, and for@@ ge a un@@ ited fron@@ t within the S@@ A@@ D@@ C that sen@@ ds a clear message to Mu@@ gabe and his gener@@ als that the region will no longer toler@@ ate their ac@@ tions.
The S@@ A@@ D@@ C should not end@@ or@@ se the regi@@ me@@ ’s claim of victory in an un@@ con@@ test@@ ed elec@@ tion.
It must insi@@ st that all opposition leaders and suppor@@ ters be fre@@ ed immedi@@ ately, and that all state-@@ sp@@ on@@ sor@@ ed violence be hal@@ ted.
It should disp@@ at@@ ch an emin@@ ent person@@ s’ group of senior African and other international leaders to Z@@ im@@ bab@@ w@@ e, as well as peace monit@@ ors to ensure that the government comp@@ lies with these dem@@ and@@ s.
The S@@ A@@ D@@ C@@ ’s c@@ ensure of Mu@@ gabe and his regime should be backed up by con@@ cre@@ te ac@@ tions, such as restric@@ tions on all arms flows to Z@@ im@@ bab@@ w@@ e, tra@@ v@@ el restric@@ tions on senior officials of Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we@@ ’s ruling Z@@ AN@@ U@@ -@@ P@@ F par@@ ty, and the threat of property sei@@ zu@@ res and the fre@@ e@@ zing of financial assets in the region and be@@ y@@ on@@ d.
M@@ bek@@ i and other S@@ A@@ D@@ C leaders should recognize a key poin@@ t. According to legal opini@@ ons com@@ mission@@ ed by the Sou@@ thern African Li@@ tig@@ ation Cent@@ er, Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we@@ ’s E@@ lec@@ tor@@ al Ac@@ t hol@@ ds that the del@@ ay or absence of a law@@ ful run@@ -@@ off means that the candidate who ob@@ tain@@ ed the most vo@@ tes in the election of Mar@@ ch 2@@ 9, 2008, has been du@@ ly elected as Pres@@ id@@ ent.
Moreover, South Africa was instru@@ mental in dra@@ f@@ ting the decl@@ ar@@ ation on un@@ constitutional changes of government, adopted by the Organ@@ ization of African Un@@ ity, the A@@ U@@ ’s pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ or, in 199@@ 9.
The man@@ ner in which the electoral process in Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we has been conduc@@ ted since Mar@@ ch has been an un@@ constitutional continu@@ ation of government.
The decl@@ ar@@ ation clearly sti@@ pul@@ ates that an inc@@ um@@ b@@ ent government’s ref@@ us@@ al to rel@@ in@@ qu@@ ish power to the winn@@ ing party after fre@@ e, fair@@ , and regul@@ ar elections is un@@ constitu@@ tion@@ al@@ . 
If South Africa se@@ es itself as spe@@ aking for Africa on the global stage and creating a vision for the contin@@ ent@@ ’s futu@@ re, it must know when to lead and how to build consen@@ sus@@ .
N@@ one of this is eas@@ y, but South Africa must now act deci@@ si@@ vely in order to poli@@ sh its tar@@ nis@@ h@@ ed ima@@ ge as a responsible regional power. “@@ Bus@@ iness as us@@ u@@ al@@ ” is no longer a vi@@ able approach for South African foreign policy.
Will new@@ ly ano@@ in@@ ted World Bank President Robert Z@@ o@@ el@@ li@@ ck be able to get the organiz@@ ation back on its fe@@ et after the c@@ atastroph@@ ic failed presiden@@ cy of Paul Wol@@ fo@@ wi@@ tz@@ ?
Although hardly a me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t st@@ ar of the Bo@@ b R@@ ub@@ in cat@@ eg@@ or@@ y, he certainly br@@ ings some positive at@@ tri@@ but@@ es to the job@@ .
First, as a key play@@ er in bringing China into the World Trade Organ@@ iz@@ ation, Z@@ o@@ el@@ li@@ ck is a pro@@ ven internation@@ alist in an American administration where internation@@ alists have sometimes seemed like an end@@ an@@ ger@@ ed speci@@ es.
Second, he is a fir@@ m beli@@ ever in the power of markets and free tra@@ de, which have clearly done far more to alle@@ vi@@ ate poverty over the past hal@@ f-@@ century than any aid program@@ .
Thir@@ d, he seems to have been a consist@@ ent behin@@ d-@@ th@@ e-@@ sc@@ en@@ es suppor@@ ter of the Bank, whereas many of his Bush administration colle@@ agu@@ es would be just as happ@@ y to see it sh@@ ut down and its Washington head@@ quar@@ ters turned into private con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums and offic@@ es.
So pres@@ um@@ ably he has a construc@@ tive vision for the Bank@@ ’s future.
But Z@@ o@@ el@@ li@@ ck is not without his weak@@ n@@ ess@@ es.
Fir@@ st and for@@ emo@@ st, his appoin@@ t@@ ment exten@@ ds the em@@ bar@@ ra@@ ss@@ ingly out@@ mo@@ ded practi@@ ce of always inst@@ all@@ ing an American in the job@@ .
With the Bank ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly pre@@ ach@@ ing the mer@@ its of good govern@@ ance, its failure to adop@@ t democratic principles under@@ cuts its own legitim@@ ac@@ y.
The claim that the World Bank needs an American president to ensure that the US ke@@ ep@@ s don@@ ating money is ri@@ dic@@ u@@ lo@@ us.
The annual cost of the US contribu@@ tion to the World Bank, even taking into account off@@ -@@ th@@ e-@@ book@@ s lo@@ an guarante@@ es, is relatively min@@ or.
An@@ y number of developing countries, from China to India to Braz@@ il, could easily step up if the US fo@@ oli@@ sh@@ ly step@@ p@@ ed dow@@ n.
Z@@ o@@ el@@ li@@ ck@@ ’s back@@ ground as a law@@ y@@ er hardly makes him perf@@ ect for the job@@ , ei@@ ther.
The World Bank presiden@@ cy is not about negoti@@ ating tre@@ ati@@ es, as Z@@ o@@ el@@ li@@ ck did when he was US Trade Re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ativ@@ e.
The Bank@@ ’s most important role in development today is as a “@@ knowledge bank@@ ” that help@@ s ag@@ greg@@ ate, di@@ still@@ , and dis@@ sem@@ in@@ ate best practi@@ ces from around the world.
In this respec@@ t, the Bank@@ ’s techni@@ cal assistance to governments is very similar to what private con@@ sul@@ tan@@ ts offer to compani@@ es.
Moreover, many of the World Bank presid@@ ent@@ ’s most important decisions invol@@ ve economics in an essential way.
W@@ ron@@ g economic decision@@ s, such as in the 197@@ 0’s, when Robert Mc@@ Nam@@ ar@@ a push@@ ed gran@@ di@@ o@@ se, but environ@@ ment@@ ally dev@@ a@@ stat@@ ing, infrastructure projec@@ ts, have ha@@ un@@ ted the Bank for decades.
The biggest question mark@@ , though@@ , is whether Z@@ o@@ el@@ li@@ ck will be able to hit the ground running and imp@@ lement des@@ per@@ ately needed reform@@ s.
Reform number one, of course, is to ensure that the next World Bank President is not an Americ@@ an.
R@@ od@@ ri@@ go de Rat@@ o, Z@@ o@@ el@@ li@@ ck@@ ’s counter@@ part at the Europe@@ an-@@ domin@@ ated International Monetary Fund@@ , has already suggest@@ ed that his success@@ or should be cho@@ sen in a more inclu@@ sive process.
The World Bank should be ash@@ am@@ ed that its president has not yet offered a similar propos@@ al.
Second, Z@@ o@@ el@@ li@@ ck should ask why the Bank sp@@ ends only 2.@@ 5% of its budget on the “@@ knowledge bank@@ ” research func@@ tion that it tru@@ mp@@ ets so pro@@ ud@@ ly in its external relations materi@@ als, while it sp@@ ends three times that amount on maintain@@ ing its execu@@ tive bo@@ ar@@ d.
Thir@@ d, Z@@ o@@ el@@ li@@ ck should use his form@@ id@@ able negoti@@ ating skill@@ s to c@@ a@@ j@@ ol@@ e rich countries into great@@ ly increasing the g@@ rant comp@@ on@@ ent of World Bank ai@@ d.
The idea that a big government@@ -@@ guarante@@ ed global bank is needed to f@@ ill hol@@ es in private capital markets is lau@@ gh@@ able nowad@@ ay@@ s.
Tru@@ e, the Bank@@ ’s poorest cli@@ ents have little access to private capital markets. By and lar@@ ge, however, the poorest countries need gran@@ ts, not loans that they still won@@ ’t be able to pay in 20 years.
As the Bank s@@ wit@@ ches from loans to gran@@ ts, it can use some of its massive re@@ tain@@ ed ear@@ n@@ ings to en@@ do@@ w its “@@ knowledge bank@@ ” func@@ tion and related techni@@ cal ad@@ vic@@ e.
But all this knowledge sh@@ oul@@ d@@ n’t be fre@@ e.
A lot of techni@@ cal ad@@ vice falls on de@@ a@@ f ear@@ s, with countries li@@ st@@ ening only long enough to get their hands on Bank mone@@ y.
Inste@@ ad of merely push@@ ing its agenda@@ , the Bank should start charg@@ ing for its techni@@ cal ad@@ vice on a gradu@@ ated scale so that more of its enga@@ gements are cli@@ ent-@@ dri@@ v@@ en.
Last but not lea@@ st, the Bank needs to play a much big@@ ger role in environmental issues and, in gener@@ al, in promoting good international citiz@@ en@@ ship by both rich and poor countries.
(@@ Some of us have been propos@@ ing this for almost two decad@@ es@@ .)
Of course, Z@@ o@@ el@@ li@@ ck could just attempt to f@@ ill the role symbo@@ lic@@ ally and do little or no@@ th@@ ing, as some of his pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ ors have don@@ e.
Or@@ , less lik@@ el@@ y, he could em@@ bra@@ ce some me@@ g@@ al@@ om@@ ani@@ ac@@ al and over-@@ reach@@ ing vision of government interven@@ tion, as others have tri@@ ed.
In any case, let@@ ’s wish him lu@@ ck@@ .
The world needs the World Bank a lot more than it needs another con@@ dom@@ ini@@ um.
The an@@ xi@@ ety over J@@ ac@@ ob Zu@@ ma@@ ’s election as president of South Africa ob@@ sc@@ ures a significant mil@@ est@@ on@@ e: for the first time in decades, a sub@@ -S@@ ahar@@ an nation has at its hel@@ m a ch@@ amp@@ i@@ on of ordinary people.
African politics has long been the exclu@@ sive dom@@ ain of ar@@ ist@@ oc@@ rat@@ s, soldi@@ ers, and tech@@ no@@ c@@ rat@@ s.
Even with the spread of democratic elec@@ tions, the region’s leaders tend to come from the ran@@ ks of soldi@@ ers (@@ U@@ g@@ and@@ a, R@@ wand@@ a, Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we@@ ), family dy@@ n@@ as@@ ties (@@ To@@ go@@ , Ken@@ y@@ a, et@@ c@@ ), or universi@@ ty prof@@ ess@@ ors, law@@ y@@ ers, and economists (@@ G@@ han@@ a, Mala@@ wi@@ , Liber@@ ia@@ ).
Now South Africa, the region’s economic eng@@ ine and home to its most s@@ op@@ h@@ istic@@ ated universi@@ ties, medi@@ a, and corpor@@ ations, has a former go@@ at her@@ der at its hel@@ m, a r@@ are African leader with the common tou@@ ch.
Z@@ um@@ a is le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y for his ability to con@@ n@@ ect with ordinary people.
H@@ e’s secure enough to d@@ ance and sing in public@@ . He spe@@ ak@@ s the langu@@ age of populi@@ sm@@ , raising hop@@ es for the vast majority of South Afric@@ ans who da@@ ily en@@ dur@@ e the mis@@ er@@ y of poor hous@@ ing, school@@ s, and health car@@ e.
In contra@@ st to his two pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ ors – the sa@@ in@@ tly N@@ el@@ son M@@ andel@@ a, who empha@@ si@@ zed ra@@ cial heal@@ ing, and the ar@@ ist@@ oc@@ ratic Th@@ ab@@ o M@@ bek@@ i, who reas@@ su@@ red financi@@ ers with his strong gra@@ s@@ p of macro@@ economics – Z@@ um@@ a recogni@@ zes the p@@ ent-@@ up demand for materi@@ al impro@@ vement in the lives of his country’s tens of millions of ha@@ ve-@@ no@@ ts. “@@ We have learned from the mistak@@ es of the past 15 years, especially the man@@ ner of which we may ha@@ ve, to some degre@@ e, neg@@ lec@@ ted the peop@@ le’s movem@@ ent@@ ,” he said in Apri@@ l, before his African National Congress s@@ we@@ p@@ t to vic@@ tor@@ y.
Un@@ til now, populi@@ sm has been the mis@@ sing no@@ te in African political cultu@@ re.
Zu@@ ma, who spent his you@@ th her@@ ding c@@ att@@ le and only gain@@ ed form@@ al education while in the no@@ tori@@ ous R@@ ob@@ ben Is@@ land pri@@ son with M@@ andel@@ a, is ref@@ res@@ h@@ ingly aw@@ are that Afric@@ a’s biggest problem is its inequ@@ ali@@ ties, not its global margin@@ aliz@@ ation. In Afric@@ a’s weal@@ th@@ i@@ est nation – but also the nation where wealth is most un@@ equally shared – a b@@ old populi@@ st now hol@@ ds ultim@@ ate power over government policy.
Yet, while Zu@@ ma@@ ’s populi@@ st appe@@ al reflects South Afric@@ a’s especially large differences in economic cl@@ as@@ s, the threat of im@@ posing higher taxes and other oblig@@ ations on employ@@ ers and the weal@@ thy has raised fear@@ s at home and internation@@ ally.
Moreover, Z@@ um@@ a has been called a ch@@ am@@ el@@ e@@ on, acc@@ used of t@@ elling his au@@ di@@ ences what they want to hear@@ .
Zu@@ ma@@ ’s tur@@ bul@@ ent personal life – many wi@@ ves and his em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ sing con@@ ten@@ tion during a rap@@ e tri@@ al that he avo@@ ided HI@@ V infec@@ tion by taking a show@@ er – has inv@@ ited ri@@ dic@@ u@@ le.
Most seri@@ ously, doub@@ ts persi@@ st about his commitment to democracy, with critic@@ s argu@@ ing he@@ ’s an old@@ -@@ style African “@@ big man@@ ” ready to bul@@ ly oppon@@ ents and ra@@ v@@ age the public co@@ ff@@ ers with his c@@ ron@@ i@@ es.
Dis@@ mis@@ sing comp@@ la@@ in@@ ts, Z@@ um@@ a insi@@ sts, “@@ Th@@ er@@ e’s no cl@@ oud around me@@ .”
His def@@ en@@ ders, mean@@ while, point to two benefits that he has already deliver@@ ed@@ : an end to M@@ bek@@ i@@ ’s ambi@@ valent approach to fighting HIV@@ /@@ AIDS@@ , the country’s major public health thre@@ at, and a ref@@ res@@ h@@ ing willingness to move against Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we@@ ’s aged dictator@@ , Robert Mu@@ ga@@ be, whom M@@ bek@@ i co@@ d@@ d@@ led out of a mis@@ gu@@ ided sense of loy@@ al@@ ty for his support during the struggle against ap@@ ar@@ th@@ ei@@ d.
In an Africa ber@@ ef@@ t of successful populi@@ st politici@@ ans, Zu@@ ma@@ ’s role model@@ s may come from Latin America, where income inequality is also extreme and the tra@@ de-@@ union movem@@ ent, as in South Africa, is strong and milit@@ ant.
With enormous pressure from ordinary people to deli@@ ver tan@@ gi@@ ble gain@@ s, Z@@ um@@ a the populi@@ st will quickly face a major test@@ : will he em@@ ul@@ ate L@@ ula of Braz@@ il, who has stru@@ ck an ad@@ mi@@ ra@@ ble balance between good economic governance and re-@@ distribution of wealth to the poor@@ ?
O@@ r will he follow the path of Hu@@ go Cháve@@ z, a popular auto@@ cra@@ t who seems to pre@@ fer building a cul@@ t of person@@ ality over raising living standards for the poor@@ .
The stak@@ es for Africa are enor@@ mo@@ us.
South Africa has the contin@@ ent@@ ’s largest economy and, until the global financial crisis, post@@ ed 10 years of ste@@ ad@@ y economic growth.
In an economic slow@@ dow@@ n, the country’s severe cri@@ me problem might only wor@@ sen@@ ; so might unemploy@@ ment, which already t@@ ops 20% in the form@@ al economy.
Z@@ um@@ a sen@@ ses the ur@@ gency of the situ@@ ation.
He is, after all, 6@@ 7 years old and likely to serve only a single term in offic@@ e. “@@ We can@@ ’t wa@@ ste ti@@ me@@ ,” he sa@@ y@@ s.
Yet, according to the political econom@@ ist Mo@@ el@@ et@@ s@@ i M@@ bek@@ i, at his cor@@ e, “@@ Z@@ um@@ a is a conserv@@ ati@@ ve@@ .” In this sen@@ se, Z@@ um@@ a repres@@ ents y@@ es@@ ter@@ da@@ y’s South Afric@@ a.
He is part of the pro@@ u@@ d generation that defe@@ ated ap@@ ar@@ th@@ ei@@ d – and then peac@@ eful@@ ly engine@@ ered a transition to du@@ ra@@ ble bl@@ ack@@ -@@ majority ru@@ le.
Their achiev@@ ement remains one of the greatest in recent histor@@ y.
At the same time, Zu@@ ma@@ ’s revolution@@ ary generation still seems un@@ easy leading South Africa in a post-@@ ap@@ ar@@ th@@ ei@@ d era that is now 15 years ol@@ d.
In a region that re@@ ver@@ es the el@@ der@@ ly, Zu@@ ma@@ ’s att@@ ach@@ ment to his rural tradi@@ tions must be mat@@ ched by an equal op@@ enn@@ ess to the appe@@ ti@@ tes of the country’s you@@ th.
Th@@ re@@ e in ten South Afric@@ ans are yo@@ ung@@ er than 1@@ 5, mean@@ ing that they did not live a day under ap@@ ar@@ th@@ ei@@ d.
Som@@ eh@@ ow Z@@ um@@ a must find a way to hon@@ or his own gener@@ ation@@ ’s commitment to ra@@ cial justice and national liber@@ ation, while em@@ power@@ ing the mass@@ es who da@@ ily suff@@ er the sting of class differences and year@@ n for materi@@ al gain@@ .
