Still@@ , the troub@@ les of the right should wor@@ ry all thinking democ@@ rat@@ s; and these troub@@ les are not con@@ fin@@ ed to Europe's wes@@ tern hal@@ f.
Two years ago I ad@@ mi@@ red the profession@@ alism with which Pol@@ and@@ 's and Hung@@ ar@@ y's righ@@ ti@@ st parties came to power.
Since then, like Western Europe's conserv@@ ativ@@ es, they managed to – at least in political terms – bo@@ t@@ ch nearly every@@ th@@ ing.
Both movem@@ ents now gar@@ ner only around 20% of support in opinion poll@@ s.
So@@ -@@ called post-@@ commun@@ ists are fl@@ ying high with around 7@@ 0@@ %.
Perhaps the collap@@ sing popul@@ arity of the right in our new democracies t@@ ells something about the right in Europe's old democra@@ cies.
For like their Western counter@@ par@@ ts, the Poli@@ sh and Hung@@ arian conserv@@ atives are cau@@ ght between their increasingly un@@ appe@@ aling ne@@ o-@@ liber@@ alism and their increasingly an@@ ach@@ ron@@ is@@ tic commun@@ itarian tradi@@ tions.
Fi@@ des@@ z in Hung@@ ary and the Solidar@@ ity E@@ lec@@ tor@@ al Alli@@ ance (@@ A@@ W@@ S@@ ) in Pol@@ and gain@@ ed power two years ago because of a re@@ action to their post-@@ communist pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ or@@ s.
During their ten@@ ures, neither post-@@ communist party ro@@ ck@@ ed the reform bo@@ at very mu@@ ch, nor did they thre@@ aten democracy.
Yet the voters were ready to move away from the old ties – the elector@@ ate had become much yo@@ ung@@ er in the 1990@@ s and the impro@@ vem@@ ents over the old regi@@ me, after the recession of the early 1990@@ s had run its course and the reform policies began to pay off@@ , became pal@@ p@@ able.
In fact, people may have been some@@ what ash@@ am@@ ed at having allowed the post-@@ commun@@ ists to win the second round of democratic elections in mid-@@ 1990@@ s.
The right always saw the post-@@ communist inter@@ lu@@ de as a type of loc@@ ust years – a time when the se@@ eds of reform wi@@ ther@@ ed.
So the righ@@ ti@@ st rhetor@@ ic har@@ den@@ ed.
No longer was it ne@@ o-@@ liber@@ al.
What we hear@@ d was a ro@@ b@@ ust form of Christi@@ an conserv@@ ati@@ sm un@@ hear@@ d since the days of de G@@ aul@@ le, A@@ den@@ au@@ er, and de Gas@@ per@@ i – and the commun@@ itarian t@@ one helped s@@ we@@ ep the post-@@ commun@@ ists a@@ way.
The right in Pol@@ and and Hung@@ ary used the commun@@ itarian rhetor@@ ic of Christi@@ an conserv@@ ati@@ sm@@ , but once in power, they re@@ ver@@ ted to their origin@@ al programs and govern@@ ed like ne@@ o-@@ liber@@ als.
The outcome was positive economic@@ ally but a disa@@ ster politi@@ call@@ y.
For people as@@ k@@ : if growth is stron@@ g, why is unemployment high@@ ?
Why are state school@@ s and health services so b@@ ad@@ ?
Why do we sud@@ den@@ ly have an under@@ class of the kind we used to see in the American cities por@@ tra@@ yed in communist pro@@ pag@@ anda fil@@ m@@ s?
As the rig@@ ors of the transition continu@@ ed, f@@ ati@@ gue set it.
And that f@@ ati@@ gue with liberal economics found res@@ on@@ ance in our mem@@ ori@@ es.
We re@@ member something called "@@ Solidar@@ it@@ y@@ ," which promised that we were equal bre@@ th@@ ren@@ ; that everyone would be taken care of@@ .
The common go@@ od, civil societ@@ y: all were to be n@@ ou@@ ri@@ shed in our post-@@ communist democra@@ cies.
Although few seri@@ ously question the free market economy and liberal individu@@ alism in man@@ ners and custom@@ s, we feel un@@ easy about for@@ s@@ aking these valu@@ es.
Two years ago our new right governments promised to t@@ ame the col@@ d@@ ness of the market with the warm@@ th of human understand@@ ing.
But in ke@@ eping to the reform path they failed to dis@@ cover a langu@@ age which re@@ conc@@ il@@ ed their policies with these go@@ als.
Their warm@@ th seemed nothing but political ho@@ t air@@ .
The so-called le@@ ft, both in Pol@@ and and in Hung@@ ary, has a langu@@ age which (@@ coming from ex@@ -@@ commun@@ ist@@ s) is bre@@ ath@@ tak@@ ingly cy@@ ni@@ c@@ al, yet effec@@ tive.
It is a carbon co@@ p@@ y of the langu@@ age of the soci@@ al-@@ democ@@ rats who are so successful in Western Europe.
Because our righ@@ t-@@ le@@ an@@ ing governments have been too dec@@ ent to use the populi@@ st langu@@ age of the radical righ@@ t, they are hel@@ pl@@ ess in appe@@ aling to mass emo@@ tions.
Their wor@@ ds appear to have nothing to do with their de@@ ed@@ s.
They talk of fam@@ il@@ y, mor@@ ality, nation@@ , but their policies lead to NATO@@ , the European Union, massive foreign invest@@ ment, international capit@@ al, and globalization – all things that appear to undermin@@ e the commun@@ itarian values of the righ@@ t.
H@@ ere our right confron@@ ts much the same di@@ lemm@@ a as that facing the right in Western Europe – how to brid@@ ge the g@@ ul@@ f between the market and the commun@@ ity.
Un@@ like in the Engli@@ sh@@ -@@ spe@@ aking world, liber@@ alism has never been really popular on the European contin@@ ent, and the conserv@@ atives have always appe@@ aled to the pat@@ rio@@ tic and religious feel@@ ings of their suppor@@ ters.
The traditional right is therefore cau@@ ght between a populi@@ st line that still appe@@ als to the voters and the liber@@ aliz@@ ing policies that are the st@@ uf@@ f of modern government every@@ wher@@ e.
The choice that the Au@@ stri@@ an conserv@@ atives now face appears to con@@ fir@@ m this stark di@@ cho@@ tom@@ y.
In this ligh@@ t, Hai@@ der may not be a historical le@@ f@@ to@@ ver som@@ eh@@ ow un@@ ear@@ th@@ ed in the moun@@ tains and val@@ le@@ ys of Car@@ in@@ th@@ i@@ a, but an au@@ g@@ ury of the future of the right across the European contin@@ ent.
There was much talk recently about the "@@ crisis of the le@@ ft@@ ," as the Lab@@ or party in Britain@@ , the Soci@@ al-@@ Democ@@ rats in Germany, and the Democ@@ rats in America had to struggle between their old soci@@ alist and New De@@ al tradi@@ tions and the im@@ per@@ atives of a modern economy, with the f@@ ad@@ ing labor uni@@ ons and other political bas@@ tions of the old le@@ ft.
The left may have not found any real answer@@ s to its predic@@ ament@@ s, but through a pragmati@@ c pat@@ ch@@ work of policies and rhetor@@ ic it managed to rec@@ la@@ im the center sta@@ ge.
All the while, the seem@@ ingly un@@ stopp@@ able mar@@ ch of the market, globaliz@@ ation, and individu@@ alism that had pro@@ p@@ ell@@ ed the right since That@@ cher and Reag@@ an came to an ab@@ rup@@ t hal@@ t.
And the commun@@ itarian tradi@@ tions of the righ@@ t, with their nation@@ alist past l@@ ur@@ king behin@@ d, may not be any easier to re@@ vit@@ alize than the old fas@@ hi@@ oned soci@@ alism or New De@@ al populi@@ sm@@ .
CAMBRIDGE – This year@@ ’s presidential campaign in the United States has been mark@@ ed by calls from Barack Obama’s w@@ oul@@ d-@@ be Republican challen@@ ger@@ s for a radical transform@@ ation of American foreign policy.
C@@ amp@@ aig@@ ns are always more extreme than the event@@ ual re@@ ality, but countries should be war@@ y of calls for transform@@ ational change.
Th@@ ings do not always work out as inten@@ ded.
Foreign policy played almost no role in the 2000 US presidential elec@@ tion.
In 2001, George W. Bush started his first term with little interest in foreign policy, but adopted transform@@ ational objec@@ tives after the September 1@@ 1, 2001, terrorist attack@@ s.
Like Wo@@ od@@ row Wil@@ son@@ , Frank@@ lin Ro@@ ose@@ vel@@ t, and Har@@ ry Tru@@ man before him@@ , Bush turned to the rhetor@@ ic of democracy to r@@ ally his fol@@ lower@@ s in a time of crisis.
Bill Clinton had also tal@@ ked about enlar@@ ging the role of human rights and democracy in US foreign policy, but most Americans in the 1990@@ ’s sought nor@@ ma@@ lity and a post-@@ Cold War peace divi@@ den@@ d rather than change.
By contrast, Bush’s 2002 National Security Strat@@ eg@@ y, which came to be called the Bush D@@ oc@@ tr@@ ine, proc@@ la@@ im@@ ed that the US would “@@ identi@@ fy and elimin@@ ate terror@@ ists wher@@ ever they are, together with the regimes that su@@ sta@@ in them@@ .”
The solution to the terrorist problem was to spread democracy every@@ wher@@ e.
Bush inv@@ aded Iraq ost@@ ensi@@ bly to re@@ move Saddam Hus@@ sein@@ ’s capacity to use weapons of mass destruc@@ tion and, in the proc@@ ess, to change the regi@@ me.
Bush cannot be blam@@ ed for the intel@@ ligence fail@@ ures that at@@ tri@@ but@@ ed such weapons to Sad@@ dam@@ , given that many other countries shared such estim@@ at@@ es.
But in@@ adequate understanding of the Iraqi and regional con@@ tex@@ t, together with poor plann@@ ing and manage@@ ment, under@@ cut Bush’s transform@@ ational objec@@ tiv@@ es.
Although some of Bush’s def@@ en@@ ders try to credit him with the “@@ Arab Sp@@ ring@@ ” revolu@@ tions, the primary Arab particip@@ ants re@@ ject such argum@@ ents.
Bush was descri@@ bed by The Econom@@ ist as “@@ ob@@ s@@ essed by the idea of being a transform@@ ational presid@@ ent@@ ; not just a stat@@ us@@ -@@ qu@@ o oper@@ ator like Bill Clint@@ on@@ .”
Th@@ en-@@ Secretary of State Con@@ d@@ ol@@ ee@@ zz@@ a Ri@@ ce p@@ raised the vir@@ tu@@ es of “@@ transform@@ ational diplom@@ ac@@ y@@ .”
But, while leadership the@@ or@@ ists and edi@@ tori@@ al wri@@ ters tend to think that transform@@ ational foreign-@@ policy officials are better in either eth@@ ics or effec@@ tiven@@ ess, the evidence does not support this view@@ .
Other leadership skill@@ s are more important than the us@@ ual distinc@@ tion between transform@@ ational and “@@ trans@@ ac@@ tion@@ al@@ ” leader@@ s.
Consider President George H@@ .@@ W. Bush@@ , who did not do “the vision th@@ ing@@ ,” but whose sound management and execu@@ tion under@@ p@@ inn@@ ed one of the most successful US foreign-@@ policy agen@@ das of the past hal@@ f-@@ century.
Perhaps genetic engine@@ ers will one day be able to produce leaders equally en@@ dow@@ ed with both vision and management skill@@ s; compar@@ ing the two Bush@@ es (@@ who shared half their gen@@ es@@ ), it is clear that nature has not yet sol@@ ved the problem.
This is not an argument against transform@@ ational leader@@ s.
Moh@@ and@@ as G@@ and@@ hi@@ , N@@ el@@ son M@@ andel@@ a, and Mar@@ ti@@ n Lu@@ ther K@@ ing, J@@ r@@ ., played crucial ro@@ les in transform@@ ing peop@@ le’s identi@@ ty and as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions.
Nor is this an argument against transform@@ ational leaders in US foreign policy.
Frank@@ lin Ro@@ ose@@ vel@@ t and Tru@@ man made crucial contribu@@ tions.
But, in jud@@ ging leader@@ s, we need to pay attention to ac@@ ts of both om@@ is@@ sion and com@@ mission@@ , to what happened and to what was avo@@ ide@@ d, to the do@@ gs that bark@@ ed and to those that did not.
A big problem in foreign policy is the comp@@ lex@@ ity of the con@@ tex@@ t.
We live in a world of di@@ verse cul@@ tur@@ es, and we know very little about social engine@@ ering and how to “@@ build nation@@ s.”
When we cannot be s@@ ure how to improve the world, p@@ ru@@ dence becomes an important vir@@ tu@@ e, and gran@@ di@@ ose vi@@ sions can pose gra@@ ve danger@@ s.
In foreign policy, as in medic@@ ine, it is important to re@@ member the H@@ i@@ p@@ po@@ c@@ ratic O@@ ath@@ : fir@@ st, do no har@@ m.
For these reason@@ s, the vir@@ tu@@ es of trans@@ ac@@ tional leaders with good con@@ tex@@ tual intel@@ ligence are very import@@ ant.
Som@@ e@@ one like George H@@ . W. Bush@@ , unable to ar@@ ticul@@ ate a vision but able to ste@@ er success@@ fully through cri@@ ses, tur@@ ns out to be a better leader than some@@ one like his son@@ , pos@@ s@@ essed of a powerful vision but with little con@@ tex@@ tual intel@@ ligence or management skill@@ .
For@@ mer Secretary of State George Sh@@ ul@@ tz@@ , who ser@@ ved under R@@ onald Reag@@ an, once compared his role to gar@@ den@@ ing –@@ “the con@@ st@@ ant n@@ ur@@ turing of a complex ar@@ ra@@ y of ac@@ tor@@ s, interest@@ s, and go@@ al@@ s.”
But Sh@@ ul@@ tz@@ ’s St@@ an@@ for@@ d colle@@ agu@@ e, Con@@ d@@ ol@@ ee@@ zz@@ a R@@ ic@@ e, wanted a more transform@@ ational diplom@@ acy that did not accept the world as it w@@ as, but tried to change it.
As one obser@@ ver put it, “@@ R@@ ic@@ e’s ambi@@ tion is not just to be a gar@@ den@@ er – she wants to be a land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e arch@@ it@@ ec@@ t@@ .” There is a role for bo@@ th, dep@@ ending on the con@@ tex@@ t, but we should avoid the common mist@@ ake of automati@@ cally thinking that the transform@@ ational land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e arch@@ it@@ ect is a better leader than the car@@ eful gar@@ den@@ er.
We should keep this in min@@ d as we ass@@ ess the current US presidential deb@@ at@@ es, with their con@@ st@@ ant refer@@ ence to American decl@@ ine.
Dec@@ line is a mis@@ leading met@@ ap@@ hor@@ .
America is not in absolu@@ te decl@@ ine, and, in relative term@@ s, there is a reason@@ able prob@@ ability that it will remain more powerful than any other country in the coming decades.
We do not live in a “@@ post-@@ American world@@ ,” but we also do not live in the American era of the late twenti@@ eth century.
The US will be faced with a rise in the power resources of many others – both states and non-@@ state ac@@ tor@@ s.
It will also confron@@ t a growing number of issues that require power with others as much as power over others in order to ob@@ tain the country’s prefer@@ red out@@ com@@ es.
America’s capacity to maintain alli@@ ances and create cooper@@ ative net@@ works will be an important di@@ men@@ sion of its hard and soft power.
The problem of America’s role in the twent@@ y-@@ first century is not one of (@@ poor@@ ly speci@@ fi@@ ed@@ ) “@@ decl@@ ine@@ ,” but rather of developing the con@@ tex@@ tual intel@@ ligence to understand that even the largest country cannot achieve what it wants without other@@ s’ help@@ .
E@@ duc@@ ating the public to understand this complex glob@@ alized information age, and what is required to oper@@ ate success@@ fully in it, will be the real transform@@ ational leadership t@@ as@@ k.
Th@@ us f@@ ar, we are not hear@@ ing much about it from the Republican candid@@ at@@ es.
On Dec@@ ember 1@@ 6, Or@@ h@@ an P@@ am@@ u@@ k, one of Turkey’s most fam@@ ous wri@@ ters, will enter an I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l cour@@ t to face a char@@ ge of “@@ ins@@ ul@@ ting the national identi@@ ty@@ ” after he advoc@@ ated open discus@@ sion of the Turkish gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de of 1.@@ 5 million Armen@@ i@@ ans in 19@@ 15 and 19@@ 1@@ 6.
P@@ am@@ u@@ k faces three years in prison@@ .
Turkey’s effort to fin@@ e and im@@ pri@@ son those who do not to@@ e the official line con@@ vin@@ ces me that I was correc@@ t to op@@ pose opening negotiations on the country’s European Union member@@ ship.
In Dec@@ ember 199@@ 9, the European Council gran@@ ted Turkey the status of EU candid@@ ate-@@ member@@ , im@@ pl@@ ying that Turkey would acc@@ e@@ de to the Union at some futu@@ re, un@@ speci@@ fied d@@ ate.
The Council sub@@ sequ@@ ently asked the European Commission to decide by Oc@@ tober 2004 whether Turkey had suffici@@ ently ful@@ fill@@ ed the political cri@@ ter@@ ia – including democracy, the rule of law, and respect for the rights of ethnic min@@ ori@@ ties – for member@@ ship.
That decision was one of the last taken by Rom@@ an@@ o Pro@@ di@@ ’s Commission@@ , of which I was a member@@ .
Of its 30 member@@ s, 2@@ 9 said that Turkey had ful@@ fill@@ ed the cri@@ ter@@ ia suffici@@ ently to proc@@ e@@ ed.
I was the l@@ one dis@@ sent@@ er.
The Commission@@ ’s own report on Turke@@ y, prepared by G@@ ün@@ ter Ver@@ heu@@ gen, who was then in char@@ ge of EU enlar@@ ge@@ ment, shap@@ ed my deci@@ sion.
This report men@@ tioned that in 2003 some 2@@ 1,@@ 8@@ 70 Tur@@ ks sub@@ mit@@ ted asy@@ l@@ um claims in the EU, of which 2,@@ 1@@ 2@@ 7 were accep@@ ted.
In other words, the EU’s own governments acknow@@ led@@ ged in 2003 that the Turkish government had per@@ sec@@ uted more than 2@@ ,000 of its own citiz@@ ens.
Meanwhile, the Commission publi@@ shed a progress report on Turkey that gran@@ ted that reforms were continu@@ ing, al@@ beit at a s@@ lower p@@ ac@@ e, under Prime Minister Rec@@ ep Ta@@ y@@ y@@ i@@ p Erdo@@ gan@@ ’s mil@@ dly Islam@@ ic@@ -@@ min@@ ded government.
Yet the report also pres@@ ented serious mis@@ gi@@ v@@ ing@@ s: human rights viol@@ ations, including tor@@ tu@@ re, continu@@ ed@@ ; the milit@@ ar@@ y’s influence remained too high@@ ; freedom of spe@@ e@@ ch was not univers@@ ally ob@@ serv@@ ed@@ ; non-@@ Muslim religious and cultural min@@ ori@@ ties faced discrimin@@ ation@@ ; and violence against women was not op@@ posed stron@@ gly enough@@ .
Not much has changed since acc@@ ession talks began this Oc@@ to@@ ber@@ .
Be@@ yond the current per@@ secu@@ tion of P@@ am@@ u@@ k, un@@ accep@@ table behavior abo@@ und@@ s.
In Mar@@ ch 200@@ 5, the police viol@@ ently dis@@ rup@@ ted a demon@@ stration to cel@@ eb@@ rate International W@@ om@@ en’s Da@@ y.
In Ma@@ y, the largest teach@@ er@@ s’ union was b@@ ann@@ ed for promoting the education of Turkey’s 1@@ 4 million Kur@@ ds in their own langu@@ age.
Indeed, in@@ toler@@ ance goes right to the top of the Turkish government.
Foreign Minister Ab@@ dul@@ la@@ h Gü@@ l ab@@ rup@@ tly canc@@ ell@@ ed a recent press con@@ ference in Copen@@ hagen when he spi@@ ed a Kur@@ dis@@ h journ@@ alist in the au@@ di@@ ence and the Dan@@ es ref@@ used to e@@ vic@@ t him@@ .
Such actions and attitu@@ des amp@@ ly justi@@ fy my dis@@ sent of Oc@@ tober 200@@ 4.
But, even if these short@@ com@@ ings were remo@@ v@@ ed, Turkey should still not be ad@@ mit@@ ted to the EU, because it is not a European country.
Christi@@ an@@ ity, f@@ eu@@ d@@ alism, the Ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance, the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment, democracy, and industri@@ alization have made us what we Europeans are, but they have not made Tur@@ ks who they ar@@ e.
So I am not convinc@@ ed that reforms in Turkey implement@@ ed at the insi@@ st@@ ence of the European Commission would continue after acc@@ ession@@ .
Indeed, I susp@@ ect that there will be back@@ s@@ li@@ d@@ ing.
Moreover, Turkey’s acc@@ ession would lead inevit@@ ably to that of Ukra@@ ine, Bel@@ ar@@ us, and M@@ ol@@ do@@ v@@ a, and perhaps of Georgi@@ a, Armen@@ i@@ a, and A@@ zer@@ b@@ a@@ ï@@ d@@ j@@ an.
The first three of these countries are certainly more European than Turke@@ y.
Le@@ a@@ ving the three C@@ au@@ c@@ asi@@ an re@@ public@@ s asi@@ de but including the success@@ or states to Yu@@ gosla@@ vi@@ a, this would mean an EU of some 3@@ 5 member@@ s.
What sort of Union would that be@@ ?
The EU is not simply a clu@@ b of friend@@ s.
It is based on freedom of movement of good@@ s, servic@@ es, capit@@ al, and people.
The Commission@@ , as the gu@@ ardi@@ an of the Uni@@ on’s tre@@ ati@@ es, must protect these four fundamental freedom@@ s, which means that it must sometimes persu@@ a@@ de, and if necessary forc@@ e, member states to change their law@@ s.
Al@@ co@@ ho@@ l policy in S@@ w@@ ed@@ en, the Volks@@ wa@@ gen@@ -@@ law in Germany, and discrimin@@ ation against foreign investment funds in France are exam@@ ples of cases that made the Commission un@@ popul@@ ar.
But they were necess@@ ary.
By the time I left the Commission@@ , I was si@@ t@@ ting on a p@@ ile of 1,@@ 500 such inf@@ rin@@ gement proc@@ e@@ ed@@ ings.
In shor@@ t, EU membership ent@@ ail@@ s having to accept inci@@ sive measures that deeply aff@@ ect a stat@@ e’s internal affair@@ s.
That will be impossible with such di@@ spar@@ ate member@@ s.
The EU would fall vic@@ ti@@ m to what the histori@@ an Paul Kenn@@ ed@@ y calls “@@ imperi@@ al over@@ reach@@ .”
The EU would become un@@ accep@@ t@@ ably di@@ lu@@ ted.
That is why former French President V@@ al@@ é@@ ry G@@ is@@ car@@ d d@@ ’@@ E@@ sta@@ ing fear@@ ed that Turkey’s ent@@ ry would lead to the EU’s break@@ up@@ , and it is why former German Chanc@@ ell@@ or H@@ elm@@ ut Sch@@ mid@@ t sa@@ id, “@@ Acc@@ ession of Turkey would be more than the EU could be@@ ar@@ .”
But the stron@@ gest reason to op@@ pose Turkey’s acc@@ ession is a question of democrac@@ y: a majority of the EU’s population simply does not want it.
NEW YORK – For those of us who have long claim@@ ed that the world’s international financial arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture needed deep reform@@ , the call for a “@@ Bre@@ tt@@ on Wo@@ ods II@@ ” is wel@@ come.
Of course, similar calls were made after the Asian and Russian crises of 199@@ 7-@@ 199@@ 8, but were not taken seri@@ ously by the rich industrial countries.
Now that these countries are at the center of the stor@@ m, perhaps they will now be seri@@ ous.
Two fundamental problems ex@@ ist with the call for reform@@ .
First, it lack@@ s con@@ t@@ ent@@ : it is un@@ clear what any event@@ ual Bre@@ tt@@ on Wo@@ ods II discus@@ sions will be ab@@ out.
Second, the process started the wrong way, by exclu@@ ding most countries from the tal@@ k@@ s.
It is ob@@ viously good for the G-@@ 7 or a sub@@ set of G-@@ 7 members to show leader@@ ship, but no fundamental reform can occ@@ ur without an inclu@@ sive process that gi@@ ves both industrial and developing countries, and both large and small countries an adequate vo@@ ic@@ e.
Global institutions, not ad ho@@ c groups of countries, must be at the center of the reform effor@@ t.
The cle@@ ar@@ est issue right now is correc@@ ting the deficit of regul@@ ations that character@@ iz@@ es global financial markets.
Dis@@ c@@ us@@ sion must start by agre@@ eing on regulatory principles .
An obvious one is that regul@@ ations must be compreh@@ ensi@@ ve, to avoid the massive lo@@ op@@ hol@@ es that led to the current tur@@ mo@@ il.
Re@@ g@@ ul@@ ations should also have a strong counter@@ -@@ cy@@ cli@@ cal foc@@ us, prev@@ enting excessive accum@@ ulation of lever@@ age and increasing capital and provi@@ sions (@@ reser@@ v@@ es@@ ) during boom@@ s, as well as prev@@ enting asset price bub@@ bl@@ es from fe@@ ed@@ ing into credit expan@@ sion.
Re@@ li@@ ance on financial institution@@ s’ internal model@@ s, the major focus of the Bas@@ el II agreement on banking regul@@ ation, should be dis@@ car@@ ded.
That strategy has now been ex@@ posed as per@@ il@@ ous, and the use by financial institutions of similar risk model@@ s can lead to greater inst@@ ability.
An@@ y new regulatory system should be based on a well func@@ tioning net@@ work of national and regional authorities (@@ still mis@@ sing in the European Uni@@ on@@ ) and include truly international super@@ vision of financial institutions with a global reach@@ .
Most agree that the International Monetary Fund should not be at the center of the regulatory system.
The Bank for International S@@ ett@@ le@@ ments and the Bas@@ el Commit@@ tee are better plac@@ ed, but a fundamental reform is needed to bro@@ aden their membership and to avoid a major problem of the Bas@@ el Commit@@ te@@ e: its lack of represent@@ ation of developing countries.
Th@@ re@@ e central issues of IMF reform should also be taken on bo@@ ar@@ d.
The first is the need for a truly global reser@@ ve curren@@ cy, perhaps based on the IMF Sp@@ eci@@ al D@@ ra@@ wing R@@ igh@@ ts (@@ S@@ DR@@ s@@ ).
This would over@@ come both the ine@@ qui@@ ties and the inst@@ ability that is inher@@ ent in a global reser@@ ve system based on a national curren@@ cy.
Toda@@ y’s system is pl@@ agu@@ ed by cy@@ cl@@ es of confidence in the dollar and by peri@@ o@@ di@@ c shock@@ s due to American policies that are adopted in@@ depend@@ ently of their global impact and thus imposed on the rest of the world.
The second issue is the need to place the IMF@@ , not the G-@@ 7 – or any other “@@ G@@ ” – at the center of global macroeconomic policy coordin@@ ation.
This is the only way to give developing countries a vo@@ ic@@ e.
The multilateral surv@@ ei@@ ll@@ ance on global im@@ balances that the Fund laun@@ ched in 2006 was an interest@@ ing step in this direc@@ tion, but it has lack@@ ed commitment by the parti@@ es, as well as te@@ eth@@ .

The third issue is developing countries’ major dem@@ and@@ .  The IMF should l@@ end during balanc@@ e-@@ of@@ -@@ pay@@ ments crises rapidly and without over@@ bur@@ den@@ ing condi@@ tions, particularly when the source of the crisis is a rapid re@@ vers@@ al of capital flows or a sharp deter@@ i@@ or@@ ation in the terms of tra@@ de. This would make the IMF more like a central bank@@ , providing liquidity in an a@@ gi@@ le way, just as advanced countries’ central banks have been providing funds on a massive scale rec@@ ent@@ ly.
In the case of the IMF@@ , the financing for such liquidity could be counter@@ -@@ cy@@ cli@@ cal issues of S@@ DR@@ s.
In all these are@@ as, the IMF should make more active use of regional institutions.
For a deca@@ de, I have proposed that the IMF of the future should be seen as the ap@@ e@@ x of a net@@ work of regional reser@@ ve funds – that is, a system closer in desig@@ n to the European Central Bank or the United States Federal Reserve system.
A similar institutional desig@@ n could be adopted for p@@ ru@@ denti@@ al policies.
A den@@ s@@ er net@@ work of institutions seems better adap@@ ted to a he@@ ter@@ o@@ gene@@ ous international commun@@ ity, and it is likely to provide better services and give a stronger vo@@ ice to smaller countries.
Finally, one major de@@ fici@@ ency of the current international financial arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture is the lack of an institutional framework – i@@ .@@ e@@ ., a cour@@ t similar to those created to manage bankrup@@ t@@ cies in national economies – to manage debt over@@ h@@ ang@@ s at the international level@@ .
The current system reli@@ es on ad ho@@ c mechan@@ ism@@ s, which generally oper@@ ate too lat@@ e, after high in@@ deb@@ ted@@ ness has already imposed dev@@ a@@ stat@@ ing effec@@ ts.
The only regul@@ ar institutional mechan@@ ism is the Par@@ is C@@ l@@ ub@@ , which de@@ als exclu@@ si@@ vely with official financ@@ ing. Bre@@ tt@@ on Wo@@ ods II should resol@@ ve this problem by creating an international debt cour@@ t.
The current financial crisis has made the need for reform of the international financial arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture pat@@ ently cle@@ ar.
But any sum@@ mon@@ s to a “@@ Bre@@ tt@@ on Wo@@ ods II@@ ” con@@ ference must be con@@ cre@@ te in its con@@ t@@ ent.
A global system for p@@ ru@@ denti@@ al regulation and super@@ vi@@ sion@@ ; a re@@ v@@ amp@@ ed IMF man@@ aging a global reser@@ ve curren@@ cy, coordin@@ ating global macroeconomic policy, and providing a@@ gi@@ le credit lin@@ es; and an international debt cour@@ t – all of these must be on the agenda@@ .
BR@@ US@@ S@@ EL@@ S – The eurozone is being th@@ rown into tur@@ mo@@ il by a collective rus@@ h to the ex@@ its by invest@@ or@@ s.
Y@@ iel@@ ds on government debt of peripher@@ al eurozone countries are sk@@ y@@ ro@@ ck@@ et@@ ing, because investors do not really know what the risks ar@@ e.
Off@@ ici@@ als want to be re@@ ass@@ ur@@ ing.
Invest@@ ors should not wor@@ ry, they argu@@ e, because the current bail@@ out mechan@@ ism – the European Financial Stability Fac@@ ili@@ ty (@@ E@@ FS@@ F@@ ) – has worked so far without any ha@@ ir@@ cut for bond@@ hol@@ ders, and will continue to be app@@ lied until about 201@@ 3.
Only after that d@@ ate would any new mechan@@ ism open the do@@ or for losses for private invest@@ ors, and only for debt issu@@ ed after that d@@ ate.
But markets do not trust this message – and for good reason@@ : it is not credi@@ ble, because it makes no economic sen@@ se.
After all, the claim that the risk of loss will ar@@ ise only for debt issu@@ ed after the new crisi@@ s-@@ res@@ olution mechan@@ ism star@@ ts in 201@@ 4 implies that all debt issu@@ ed until then is saf@@ e, and that in@@ sol@@ ven@@ cy can occ@@ ur only in some dist@@ ant futu@@ re, rather than now, as in Greece and I@@ rel@@ and. In effec@@ t, EU officials are sa@@ ying to invest@@ ors, “@@ W@@ ho@@ m do you believe – us or your own ey@@ es@@ ?@@ ”
Moreover, for too many invest@@ ors, Portug@@ al, with its poor growth prospec@@ ts and in@@ sufficient domestic savings to f@@ und the public-@@ sector defic@@ it, looks like Greec@@ e.
And Spain clearly has to gra@@ pp@@ le with its own I@@ ris@@ h proble@@ m, nam@@ ely a huge housing over-@@ hang – and probably large losses in the banking sector – following the collapse of an out@@ si@@ zed re@@ al-@@ est@@ ate bub@@ ble.
The problems of Portug@@ al and Spain might be less severe than those of Greece and I@@ rel@@ and, but this appar@@ ently is not enough to in@@ duce investors to buy their government debt.
A danger these countries share is thus the ac@@ ute danger of lar@@ ge-@@ scale r@@ uns on their banking system@@ s.
So f@@ ar, investors trying to ex@@ it first have been made whol@@ e.
H@@ ol@@ ders of Greek debt mat@@ uring now are re@@ paid cour@@ tes@@ y of the €@@ 1@@ 10 billion bail@@ out progra@@ m, and hol@@ ders of I@@ ris@@ h bank bonds have been given a guarantee by the I@@ ris@@ h government, whose promises have in turn been under@@ w@@ ritten by the E@@ FS@@ F@@ .
The E@@ FS@@ F will also provide funds to ensure that I@@ ris@@ h bank@@ s’ deposi@@ tors can get their money back today.
The problem with this approach is that it cre@@ ates the wrong incen@@ tiv@@ es.
Invest@@ ors have now learned that the first to sell will avoid los@@ ses.
The situation res@@ em@@ bl@@ es that of a c@@ row@@ ded c@@ in@@ em@@ a with only one ex@@ it.
E@@ ver@@ y@@ one knows that in case of fi@@ re, only the first to leave will be saf@@ e.
So, if the ex@@ it is sm@@ all, even the f@@ ain@@ test whi@@ ff of smo@@ ke can trig@@ ger a st@@ am@@ pe@@ de.
But if the ex@@ it looks com@@ fort@@ ably lar@@ ge, the public will be much more likely to remain cal@@ m, even if parts of the ro@@ om are already fill@@ ing with smo@@ k@@ e.
For the financial market, the size of the ex@@ it depends on the funds available to make short-term investors whol@@ e.
Unfortunately, the size of the E@@ FS@@ F looks in@@ adequate to finance a collective ex@@ it by short-term invest@@ or@@ s.
When the E@@ FS@@ F was cre@@ ated, it was assum@@ ed that the only problem was to ensure financing for the government deficits of the four prospec@@ tive problem countries (@@ Portug@@ al, I@@ rel@@ and, Greec@@ e, and Spain@@ ).
From this per@@ spec@@ tive, the head@@ line fig@@ ure of €@@ 7@@ 50 billion alloc@@ ated to the E@@ FS@@ F look@@ ed adequ@@ ate.
But the E@@ FS@@ F@@ ’s fo@@ under@@ s did not take into account bank@@ s’ enormous short-term li@@ abili@@ ties, which in a crisis effectively become government debt, as I@@ re@@ land has been the most recent to demonstrat@@ e.
The E@@ FS@@ F might be just enough to guarantee the public debt of the four problem countries, but certainly not their banking sector@@ s’ li@@ abilities as well.
For example, the Sp@@ an@@ ish banking sector alone has short-term li@@ abilities of several hund@@ red billion euro@@ s.
To return to the c@@ in@@ em@@ a an@@ alo@@ g@@ y: investors know that the ex@@ it is not large enough to allow them all to squ@@ ee@@ ze through at the same time.
So each one want to be among the first to get out.
The official line so far has been “@@ no defaul@@ t@@ ,” mean@@ ing no sovereign default or that of any bank can be consider@@ ed.
If this line is to be maintain@@ ed, the ex@@ it do@@ or must immedi@@ ately be made much wi@@ der, and huge fir@@ e ex@@ t@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ her@@ s must be bran@@ di@@ sh@@ ed.
The International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank must show investors that they have enough funding to finance the si@@ mul@@ tane@@ ous ex@@ it of all short-term invest@@ or@@ s.
It could work.
A show of overwhelm@@ ing force might restore cal@@ m to the markets.
But it is a risk@@ y pro@@ posi@@ tion@@ : if investors ex@@ it non@@ eth@@ eless, the required funds might be so large that credi@@ tor countries’ taxpay@@ er@@ s’ re@@ vol@@ t.
The alternative is to change strategy and focus instead on invest@@ or@@ s’ incen@@ tiv@@ es.
Pati@@ ent investors should be re@@ war@@ ded.
In particul@@ ar, they should be able to expect to be better off than those rus@@ h@@ ing to the ex@@ it.
This approach depends on two major policy shif@@ ts.
First, governments should not be push@@ ed into in@@ sol@@ ven@@ cy just to save all bank@@ s.
This means that the I@@ ris@@ h government (@@ ma@@ y@@ be the next on@@ e) should demand that hol@@ ders of bank bonds share the los@@ ses, perhaps by off@@ ering them a simple deb@@ t-@@ equity s@@ w@@ ap@@ .
D@@ ou@@ b@@ ts about the I@@ ris@@ h government’s sol@@ ven@@ cy would then dis@@ appear quick@@ ly, and its guarantee of bank deposi@@ ts would no longer look so sh@@ ak@@ y.
Som@@ ething similar might have to be done for the Sp@@ an@@ ish banking system@@ ’s ex@@ pos@@ ure to the local housing market.
The second comp@@ on@@ ent of a permanent anti-@@ crisis mechan@@ ism is a flo@@ or for bond prices – and thus a c@@ ei@@ ling for los@@ ses.
The yiel@@ ds and volati@@ lity of lon@@ ger@@ -@@ term bonds should then fall relative to short-term securi@@ ties, allow@@ ing peripher@@ al governments to finance themselves reli@@ ably and at reason@@ able co@@ st.
N@@ one of this would resol@@ ve Europe’s fundamental problem@@ s, nam@@ ely weak fiscal posi@@ tions, poor@@ ly func@@ tioning financial sector@@ s, and lack of competi@@ tiven@@ ess.
But all of them would be easier to manage with cal@@ mer financial markets.
T@@ BI@@ L@@ I@@ S@@ I – Given the tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous damage that Russia has inf@@ lic@@ ted on Georgi@@ a, it is easy to conclu@@ de that the Kremlin has achieved its objec@@ tiv@@ es.
But, so f@@ ar, Russia has failed in its real goal – getting ri@@ d of Mik@@ hei@@ l Sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vili@@ , Georgi@@ a’s pro-@@ democracy, pro-@@ American presid@@ ent.
To be sure, Russia has ti@@ ghten@@ ed its control of the separ@@ ati@@ st enc@@ la@@ ves of South Os@@ se@@ ti@@ a and Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zi@@ a. It sh@@ at@@ tered the Georgi@@ an milit@@ ary, gri@@ ev@@ ously dam@@ aged Georgi@@ a’s economy, and sti@@ r@@ red up dis@@ cor@@ d within the Western alli@@ ance.
For three years, it has tried every conc@@ ei@@ v@@ able tac@@ tic to bring Sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i down – f@@ om@@ enting a domestic u@@ pri@@ s@@ ing, im@@ posing an economic block@@ a@@ de, be@@ ef@@ ing up its forces in the enc@@ la@@ ves, and finally a war.
Yet Georgi@@ a’s president remains in power.
H@@ ere in T@@ bili@@ si@@ , ten@@ sion is understand@@ ably high@@ .
Russian t@@ anks are less than 25 mil@@ es a@@ way, and the whe@@ at fiel@@ ds along the main road to Gor@@ i were ab@@ la@@ z@@ e, set on fir@@ e by Russian tro@@ op@@ s, as I dro@@ ve through Russian ch@@ eck@@ points to get to that deser@@ ted, occup@@ ied c@@ ity.
(@@ Most mem@@ or@@ able si@@ gh@@ t: dr@@ unk@@ en Russian soldi@@ ers in st@@ ol@@ en Georgi@@ an uni@@ forms – “@@ because they are better than our@@ s@@ .@@ ”@@ )
Russia’s inv@@ asion of Georgi@@ a has res@@ h@@ ap@@ ed the strategic land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e.
But, as the West deb@@ ates how to “@@ pun@@ ish Russi@@ a@@ ,” it is vital to re@@ member that the main fron@@ t is still in Georgi@@ a.
T@@ al@@ k about taking away the 201@@ 4 Win@@ ter Olymp@@ ics or e@@ jec@@ ting Russia from the G-@@ 8 may (or may not@@ ) have some effect on the Krem@@ lin@@ , but the most important thing the West can do now is strengthen the government in T@@ bili@@ si@@ .
The equ@@ ation is simp@@ le@@ : if Sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i survi@@ ves, Vladimir Putin los@@ es.
The inten@@ se personal hat@@ red between these men over@@ la@@ ys two cent@@ uri@@ es of tor@@ tured history between Russia and Georgi@@ a.
Many people report that Putin simply “@@ los@@ es it@@ ” when disc@@ uss@@ ing the up@@ start Sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vili@@ , who led his country from near bankrup@@ t@@ cy into a g@@ ol@@ den age of economic growth and the world’s highest rate of foreign direct investment relative to GDP.
All this has been hal@@ ted by Russian t@@ ank@@ s.
The Kremlin has probably lost its chance to re@@ move Sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i by over@@ t forc@@ e, although sin@@ ist@@ er, more ste@@ al@@ thy means cannot be rul@@ ed out.
Ha@@ ving just d@@ ined with him in a public res@@ tau@@ ran@@ t, I wish his security was a little ti@@ gh@@ ter.
(@@ His pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ or, E@@ du@@ ard Sh@@ ev@@ ard@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ e, was a ne@@ ar-@@ mis@@ s target for several ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation attemp@@ ts that are widely believed to have been Russi@@ an-@@ direc@@ ted@@ .) The Krem@@ lin@@ ’s best hope now is that Georgi@@ a’s economy will cru@@ m@@ ble, its currency will collap@@ se, and an un@@ happ@@ y popul@@ ac@@ e, encoura@@ ged by some opposition leader (@@ perhaps bank@@ ro@@ ll@@ ed by Russi@@ a@@ ), will force Sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i from power.
The Western response to this challenge must go beyond rhetor@@ ic@@ .
What matters most right now is massive economic and military assi@@ st@@ ance.
Pub@@ li@@ c commit@@ ments to help re@@ build Georgi@@ a are the best way to prevent Russia from achiev@@ ing its go@@ al.
Prime Minister Vladimir G@@ ur@@ gen@@ id@@ ze estim@@ ates that re@@ building ra@@ il@@ road@@ s, brid@@ ges, por@@ ts and other infrastructure will cost at least $@@ 1 billi@@ on@@ ; this does not include human@@ itarian reli@@ ef@@ , refu@@ ge@@ e res@@ ett@@ lement cost@@ s, or re@@ building Georgi@@ a’s milit@@ ary.
G@@ ur@@ gen@@ id@@ ze also for@@ es@@ e@@ es negative economic growth, a huge budget defic@@ it, and a collapse of tou@@ ris@@ m, which was just taking off in this be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful country.
United States Sen@@ ator J@@ ose@@ p@@ h Bi@@ den has called for an immediate $@@ 1 billion supp@@ lement@@ al appropri@@ ation, a proposal quickly end@@ or@@ sed by Barack Obam@@ a.
But the Bush administration has not yet been specific on economic suppor@@ t.
Congress will be in s@@ ession only bri@@ ef@@ ly before the elec@@ tion, and a supp@@ lement@@ al appropri@@ ation will p@@ ass only if President Bush pursu@@ es it vi@@ g@@ or@@ ously as a bi@@ parti@@ s@@ an measu@@ re.
Even if del@@ a@@ yed until next year, its immediate proposal by Bush and end@@ or@@ s@@ ement by both presidential candidates would help mor@@ ale in Georgi@@ a.
The European Union, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund@@ , and the European Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struc@@ tion and Development must mat@@ ch American suppor@@ t.
In the long run@@ , Georgi@@ a and Russia must co@@ ex@@ ist peac@@ eful@@ ly.
Her@@ e, Georgi@@ a must do its par@@ t.
Sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vili@@ , an immen@@ sely tal@@ ented 4@@ 1@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ d, sa@@ ved his country from ut@@ ter collapse in 200@@ 3. But he must think strategi@@ cally about the future.
On occ@@ a@@ sion, he has ber@@ ated the Europeans for in@@ sufficient support – not a good tac@@ tic for some@@ one trying to join the EU – and has used rhetor@@ ic about Russia that, while understand@@ able, only increases the danger to him@@ self@@ .
Sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i cannot p@@ ick up his tin@@ y country and move it to Mexico@@ .
He has to manage the situation with greater car@@ e.
There will be consequ@@ enc@@ es, of course, for Russia’s relations with the Wes@@ t.
(@@ Bush’s in@@ atten@@ tiveness to this Russian threat – dramati@@ cally illu@@ strat@@ ed by his liter@@ al em@@ bra@@ ce of Putin in Beij@@ ing as Russian t@@ anks ro@@ ll@@ ed into Georgi@@ a – may have led the Kremlin to think it could get away with its inv@@ a@@ sion@@ .)
While the West will not going to war over Georgi@@ a, Russia must understand that it will pay for using forc@@ e, or the threat of forc@@ e, against neighbor@@ s that were once part of the Soviet sp@@ ac@@ e.
This is especially true for Ukraine and A@@ zer@@ b@@ ai@@ j@@ an, which are likely to be Mosco@@ w@@ ’s next targe@@ ts for in@@ tim@@ id@@ ation.
The rules of the post-@@ Cold War world are changing – but not to the ultim@@ ate benefit of Russia, which has under@@ estimated the uni@@ fying effect its actions will have on the Wes@@ t.
Ex@@ ac@@ tly how these relation@@ ships evol@@ ve depends on what each side does in the coming week@@ s – especially in Georgi@@ a.
It is fas@@ hi@@ on@@ able in Russia to di@@ spar@@ age our fundamental shift in foreign policy that followed the terrorist attacks on the US last year.
According to this view, Russia sol@@ d its loy@@ al@@ ty to the US-@@ led anti-@@ ter@@ ror coalition too che@@ ap@@ ly.
In exchange for more bilateral and multilateral financ@@ ing, Russia now faces growing US military bas@@ es on its southern fl@@ ank in Central Asia and the C@@ au@@ cas@@ us, while NATO is po@@ is@@ ed to exp@@ and right up to our Western bor@@ der.
But ho@@ we@@ ver justi@@ fied critic@@ ism of growing US unilater@@ alism may be@@ --@@ in the so-called war on terrorism and elsewher@@ e-@@ -@@ the gra@@ v@@ est risks facing Russia li@@ e elsewher@@ e.
The first concerns the most basic interest of any stat@@ e: defense of its territori@@ al integ@@ rit@@ y.
H@@ ere the most immediate threat is not posed by America or NATO@@ , but by the European Union, whose enlar@@ gement means that member states will soon sur@@ round Russia's K@@ al@@ in@@ ing@@ ra@@ d region on all sid@@ es.
Russia's task is to ensure that this does not im@@ pe@@ de the free movement of people and goods between K@@ al@@ in@@ ing@@ ra@@ d and the rest of the country.
This is a vital condi@@ tion for ke@@ eping the region Russi@@ an, and special EU transi@@ t vis@@ as should therefore be gran@@ ted to K@@ al@@ in@@ ing@@ ra@@ d@@ 's res@@ id@@ ents in order to ensure simp@@ li@@ fied tra@@ v@@ el through ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent EU countries.
The EU, however, does not want to give K@@ al@@ in@@ ing@@ ra@@ d@@ 's citizens such righ@@ ts.
A solution must be found@@ , not least because the EU@@ 's attitu@@ de to the K@@ al@@ in@@ ing@@ ra@@ d problem will be a lit@@ mus test of its desire for broader rap@@ pro@@ ch@@ ement with Russia.
Our mist@@ ake was to bro@@ ach the subject of "@@ cor@@ ri@@ dor@@ s@@ " lin@@ king K@@ al@@ in@@ ing@@ ra@@ d with the rest of Russia.
Pol@@ and immedi@@ ately associated the idea with the pre-@@ war Dan@@ zig (@@ G@@ dan@@ sk@@ ) Cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or and interpre@@ ted it as an ex@@ -@@ territori@@ al enc@@ ro@@ ach@@ ment on Poli@@ sh sovereign@@ ty.
But this is not so.
We are tal@@ king about tran@@ sp@@ ort ro@@ utes for people and good@@ s, nothing more .
Com@@ m@@ on sense should prev@@ ail@@ .
The second risk facing Russia is no less da@@ un@@ t@@ ing.
O@@ wing to a ste@@ ep@@ ly decl@@ ining bir@@ th rate and falling life expect@@ anc@@ y-@@ -@@ largely the result of poor di@@ et, widespread smo@@ k@@ ing, and al@@ co@@ ho@@ l ab@@ us@@ e-@@ -@@ Russia's population is contrac@@ ting by nearly a million people per year.
L@@ it@@ t@@ le, if any@@ th@@ ing, is being done to stem the demograph@@ ic crisis, and it cannot be resol@@ ved by a higher bir@@ th rate alone (@@ although this is ob@@ viously an important factor@@ ).
Moreover, the crisis is ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ated by the un@@ even distribution of the population throughout Russia, with a near v@@ ac@@ u@@ um in the F@@ ar East and Si@@ ber@@ i@@ a.
A v@@ ac@@ u@@ um never survi@@ ves for lon@@ g.
But can Russia manage to per@@ mit controlled and measu@@ red immig@@ ration@@ ?
After all, the US ge@@ ts a million new citizens annu@@ ally from Latin America, mostly Mexico@@ , and the Itali@@ an population grow@@ s annu@@ ally by 9@@ 0@@ ,000 Afri@@ can@@ s.
The difference is liter@@ ally one of degre@@ es - educ@@ ational degre@@ es.
When a well-@@ educ@@ ated, skill@@ ed for@@ eig@@ ner em@@ ig@@ rates to the US, he or she can hope to ob@@ tain citiz@@ en@@ ship relatively so@@ on.
For@@ eign@@ ers with less developed skill@@ s, on the other hand, must work di@@ lig@@ ently for several years to ob@@ tain permanent res@@ iden@@ cy.
In Russia, we lack any such gra@@ d@@ ation.
So we need to form@@ ul@@ ate, jo@@ in@@ tly with neighbor@@ ing countries, a legal framework for immig@@ ra@@ tion.
Our policy should be exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly designed to fo@@ ster a more developed economic and social infrastructure in Eastern Russia.
C@@ ur@@ r@@ ently, those who want to sett@@ le in Russia em@@ ig@@ rate overwhelm@@ ingly from the C@@ I@@ S countries, and 9@@ 9@@ % of them sett@@ le in European Russia.
Un@@ less we equ@@ alize conditions throughout the country, the already pro@@ found regional disp@@ ari@@ ties will wor@@ sen.
This will require that we accept not only ex@@ -@@ Soviet citizens but also Chinese and Korean immig@@ ran@@ ts.
The third challenge that Russia fac@@ es@@ --@@ one related to addres@@ sing its demograph@@ ic crisi@@ s@@ --@@ is the need to diversi@@ fy investment to ensure more even economic development, both geo@@ graph@@ ically and by sector@@ .
C@@ apit@@ al that has accum@@ ul@@ ated in the ra@@ w materi@@ als sector in recent years should be shif@@ ted to manufacturing and infrastructu@@ re.
C@@ ur@@ r@@ ently, only oil production and export benefit from capital accum@@ ul@@ ation, whereas large su@@ ms are simply being sent out of the country.
President Vladimir Putin recently hin@@ ted that Russians with cas@@ h in off@@ shor@@ e accoun@@ ts may find their funds f@@ ro@@ zen p@@ ending au@@ di@@ ts of money susp@@ ec@@ ted of assi@@ sting terrorist group@@ s.
While Russia itself will not fre@@ e@@ ze accoun@@ ts, President Putin@@ 's mean@@ ing was cle@@ ar@@ : it would be better for all sides if this money were brought home and invest@@ ed in the national economy.
To achieve this end, Russia must create a secure and attrac@@ tive investment clim@@ ate.
Most importantly, if we are to re@@ verse capital f@@ ligh@@ t, the government must persu@@ ade individual sa@@ vers that they can deposi@@ t money saf@@ ely and with@@ draw it on dem@@ and.
How can the government expect to mobili@@ ze domestic investment as long as ordinary Russians keep their sav@@ ing@@ s@@ --@@ $@@ 50 billi@@ on, according to most estim@@ at@@ es@@ --@@ at hom@@ e?
Russia's people need to be convinc@@ ed of the country's political stabilit@@ y-@@ -@@ that, for example, no@@ body will suggest nation@@ aliz@@ ation, as happened repe@@ at@@ edly during the ei@@ ght months that I was prime minist@@ er.
The model of soci@@ alism that exist@@ ed in the Soviet Union is de@@ ad@@ ; even the Communist Party does not seri@@ ously question the need for market economic rel@@ ations.
But the man@@ ner in which the market is established and oper@@ ates is another mat@@ ter.
Unfortunately, central plann@@ ing was not the only way to deep@@ en Russia's back@@ war@@ d@@ ness relative to the Wes@@ t.
NEW YORK – C@@ amp@@ aig@@ n@@ s, be they political or milit@@ ary, are w@@ aged to be w@@ on, and the current American presidential campaign is no excep@@ tion.
The Democratic and Republican candidates are doing all they can to dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ish themselves from an un@@ popular inc@@ um@@ b@@ ent president and from one another in the rema@@ ining week@@ s before Americans vo@@ te.
For good reas@@ on, much attention is focused on foreign policy differences between the two nom@@ ine@@ es, which in many areas are both obvious and consider@@ able.
Still@@ , it is possible to disc@@ ern some simil@@ ari@@ ties between them, in part because some of their dis@@ agreements are not as p@@ ron@@ oun@@ c@@ ed as they seem@@ , and in part because the constra@@ in@@ ts that the next president of the United States will face are certain to limit what either man could do in offic@@ e.
Consider Iraq, the most divi@@ sive issue in American politics for the past five years.
Barack Obama regul@@ arly points out that the decision to go to war was deeply f@@ law@@ ed@@ ; John Mc@@ C@@ ain empha@@ si@@ zes how much things have turned around since early 2007, when US tro@@ op numbers were increased and US strategy re@@ vis@@ ed.
Ob@@ ser@@ vers could be for@@ given for thinking that they are spe@@ aking about two entirely different conflic@@ ts.
But what about the futu@@ re@@ ?
No matter who w@@ ins this Novem@@ ber, it is clear that Iraq will not domin@@ ate US foreign policy in the years ahead to anything near the degree that it has in recent years.
We are ent@@ ering the post-@@ Iraq era of American foreign policy.
Consi@@ st@@ ent with this, the US military presence is de@@ creas@@ ing.
Wh@@ ere the two candidates diff@@ er is on the tim@@ ing and p@@ ace of this draw@@ dow@@ n, not on its general direc@@ tion.
By contrast, the US commitment to Afghanistan will increas@@ e, and tro@@ op levels will clim@@ b@@ .
Beh@@ in@@ d this predic@@ tion is a widely shared ass@@ ess@@ ment that the tren@@ ds in Afghanistan (@@ un@@ like in Iraq@@ ) are neg@@ ative, and that the US must strengthen its military presence there and re@@ vis@@ e its strategy if the Taliban are not to gain the u@@ pp@@ er hand@@ .
It is also widely under@@ stood that Pakistan has become part of the problem.
Pakistan@@ ’s wes@@ tern reach@@ es are now a sanc@@ tu@@ ary for m@@ ili@@ ti@@ as and terror@@ ists that are moving in and out of Afghanist@@ an.
Her@@ e, Barack Obama appears more willing to have the US laun@@ ch unilater@@ al military ra@@ id@@ s against terror@@ ists should the opportunity ar@@ is@@ e.
But wh@@ o@@ ever is elected will confron@@ t difficult choic@@ es if a nu@@ cle@@ ar-@@ armed Pakistan remains unable or un@@ willing to act as an American partn@@ er and meet its responsi@@ bili@@ ties in the effort against terror@@ ism.
A third area of some consensus (and some dist@@ ance from George W. Bush@@ ) is climate change.
Un@@ der the next president, the US will no longer be a dra@@ g on international efforts to create a global regime that s@@ ets a c@@ ei@@ ling on green@@ house gas emis@@ sions.
One result of this likely ev@@ olution in US policy is that pressure will shift to other countries, particularly China and India, to accept some limits on their own economic behavi@@ or.
A President Mc@@ C@@ ain or Obama will take steps to improve America’s ima@@ ge in the world.
One of his first decisions will be to imp@@ lement a ban on all forms of tor@@ tu@@ re.
Also to be expected early on is a decision to close the fac@@ ili@@ ty at Gu@@ ant@@ á@@ nam@@ o B@@ a@@ y, where terrorism susp@@ ec@@ ts have been held for years without tri@@ al.
Iran is another area where the differences – at least initi@@ ally – may not be as sharp as the campaign suggest@@ s.
Both candidates have st@@ res@@ sed that an Iran with nuclear weapons would be un@@ accep@@ t@@ able.
The vic@@ tor will almost su@@ rely end@@ or@@ se a new diplomatic initi@@ ative aimed at ending Iran’s independent ability to en@@ rich ur@@ ani@@ um.
L@@ ess clear are the de@@ tail@@ s of such an initi@@ ative, or what the US would do if it were to fail@@ .
The candid@@ at@@ es’ stat@@ ements on Iran do suggest two different philosop@@ hi@@ es of diplom@@ ac@@ y.
Obama seems to regard meeting with foreign leaders as a normal comp@@ on@@ ent of foreign policy, to be employ@@ ed as one of many tool@@ s.
Mc@@ C@@ ain appears to em@@ bra@@ ce the view that such me@@ et@@ ings are something of a re@@ war@@ d, to be offered when pre@@ conditions are met (@@ Iran comes to min@@ d@@ ) and withdraw@@ n when certain lines are cros@@ s@@ ed, as Russia was jud@@ ged to have done this August in Georgi@@ a.
Despite such differ@@ enc@@ es, either would carry out policies closer to those of Bush’s second term than his fir@@ st.
With a stra@@ ined military and a stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing economy, the next president will often have little choice other than to tal@@ k.
On other issu@@ es, such as tra@@ de, there are distinc@@ tions between the candid@@ at@@ es.
Mc@@ C@@ ain is a stronger advoc@@ ate of free trade than Obama is.
But this difference may have less impact than me@@ ets the ey@@ e.
Congress pla@@ ys a large role in trade policy, and the near certain@@ ty that the Democratic Par@@ t@@ y’s majority in Congress will grow after the election means that protection@@ ism will grow as well.
Di@@ ff@@ icul@@ t economic times will make it hard to generate support for trade p@@ ac@@ ts, despite the current importance of export@@ -@@ ori@@ ented firms for the American economy.
There are real and important differences between the two candidates when it comes to how they would approach the world.
But there are also more simil@@ ari@@ ties than might be evi@@ dent from the deb@@ ates and the campaig@@ n.
A@@ spec@@ ts of the next presid@@ ent@@ ’s foreign policy are there to see if obser@@ vers re@@ ad between the lines and take as much no@@ te of what is not said as what is.
As Argentin@@ a's economy un@@ ra@@ vel@@ s in stre@@ et demon@@ stra@@ tions, food rio@@ ts, and political t@@ um@@ ul@@ t, conventional wis@@ dom suggests that a le@@ th@@ al combin@@ ation of reck@@ less government spending and a fix@@ ed exchange rate is to blam@@ e.
L@@ ar@@ ge fiscal defic@@ its, so this argument go@@ es, p@@ ump@@ ed up domestic dem@@ and, which fuel@@ ed inflation and caused the p@@ es@@ o to appreci@@ ate in real term@@ s, even though it was pe@@ g@@ ged to the US dollar at a nomin@@ al one-@@ to-@@ one exchange rat@@ e.
As public debt gre@@ w@@ , the government@@ 's only hope of pa@@ ying it back was a defl@@ ation@@ ary cl@@ amp@@ down on available money and credi@@ t-@@ -@@ with a collapse in out@@ pu@@ t, so@@ aring unemploy@@ ment, and civil dis@@ order almost inevit@@ able.
This line of reason@@ ing is plausi@@ ble, because exchange rate mis@@ ali@@ gn@@ ment may inde@@ ed be at the heart of Argentin@@ a's problems (@@ al@@ beit for very different reasons that we will not ex@@ pl@@ or@@ e her@@ e, one associated with a sud@@ den stop in capital flow@@ s@@ ).
But fiscal prof@@ lig@@ acy alone cannot explain Argentin@@ a's mel@@ t@@ dow@@ n.
Th@@ rough@@ out the 1990@@ s, Argentin@@ a's budget deficit never exc@@ ee@@ ded 2% of GDP@@ , with the excep@@ tion of 199@@ 9, when it ro@@ se to 2.@@ 5@@ %, before falling back to 2.@@ 4% in 200@@ 0.
While public-@@ sector borrowing push@@ ed external debt from 2@@ 8@@ .@@ 4% of GDP in 1991 to 5@@ 1.@@ 4% in 200@@ 0, this still compar@@ es favor@@ ably with countries ren@@ owned for their fiscal prob@@ ity.
The European Union, for example, requires its member states to c@@ ap budget deficits and public debt, respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y, at 3% and 60@@ % of GDP.
Moreover, like Argentin@@ a's dollar pe@@ g, most EU countries aband@@ oned control over their exchange rates by adop@@ ting the euro@@ .
Yet no one suggests that Germany, France, or Italy risk shar@@ ing Argentin@@ a's f@@ ate.
One key difference between Argentin@@ a and the EU is the huge risk pre@@ mi@@ um that Argentin@@ a must pay for its debt, which im@@ poses much nar@@ ro@@ wer limits on the sustain@@ ability of its fiscal defic@@ its.
Indeed, in 200@@ 0, interest pay@@ ments on the public debt equ@@ aled 16@@ .@@ 5% of Argentin@@ a's total budget revenu@@ es.
Wh@@ y, then, was Argentin@@ a tre@@ ated so differ@@ ently in 200@@ 1@@ ?
Som@@ ething essential is mis@@ sing from the conventional stor@@ y: money and bank@@ ing.
Like other emerging market economies, liber@@ aliz@@ ing reforms in the early 1990@@ s attrac@@ ted massive inf@@ low@@ s of foreign credi@@ t.
But after ro@@ b@@ ust economic growth in 199@@ 1@@ -@@ 9@@ 4, Argentin@@ a was hit by the Mexi@@ can crisis, which produced capital f@@ ligh@@ t, a run on bank deposi@@ ts, and a sever@@ e, but short-@@ li@@ v@@ ed, recession@@ .
Argentin@@ a's main response - encoura@@ ging lar@@ ge-@@ scale foreign investment in the banking sector - sought to ensure that this would not happen again, given that there would now be an international l@@ ender of last res@@ or@@ t.
With confidence restor@@ ed, real GDP growth re@@ bo@@ unded stron@@ g@@ ly, reach@@ ing 8@@ .@@ 1% in 199@@ 7.
With a largely foreign-@@ owned - and thus well-@@ capit@@ alized - banking sector@@ , Argentin@@ a remained ins@@ ul@@ ated from the sud@@ den re@@ vers@@ als of capital flows that fuel@@ ed crises in emerging markets after 199@@ 7.
But soon after taking the hel@@ m at the Econom@@ ics Minist@@ ry in Mar@@ ch 2001, D@@ om@@ ing@@ o C@@ av@@ all@@ o poin@@ ted an acc@@ using f@@ ing@@ er at the central bank@@ .
Not@@ with@@ standing the fix@@ ed exchange rat@@ e, which limited monetary growth to that of the bank@@ 's dollar reser@@ ves, he argued that economic recovery required an expan@@ sion@@ ary credit policy.
The standard view among economists is that re@@ la@@ x@@ ing monetary policy under a fix@@ ed exchange rate regime will cause capital to f@@ le@@ e, especially when investors are already j@@ it@@ ter@@ y about the effects of a de@@ valu@@ ation in a largely doll@@ ari@@ zed economy, which typ@@ ically invol@@ ves a bank bail@@ out and a loss in reserves to pay for it.
P@@ ed@@ ro P@@ ou@@ , Argentin@@ a's central bank president and a strong def@@ ender of the standard view, was s@@ ack@@ ed, and the bank increased credit shar@@ pl@@ y.
Unfortunately, the conventional view was righ@@ t.
By Dec@@ ember 2001, international reserves fell to less than half their Janu@@ ary level@@ , with credit expansion accoun@@ ting for about 5@@ 3% of the los@@ s. (@@ mean@@ while, the spread on government bonds j@@ ump@@ ed from 9@@ 7@@ 3 to 4@@ 4@@ 3@@ 5 poin@@ ts@@ ).
The rest was due to an 18@@ % decline in deposi@@ ts, with the loss of confidence mainly h@@ it@@ ting state-@@ owned bank@@ s.
Since their deposi@@ ts far exc@@ ee@@ ded Argentin@@ a's international reser@@ ves, the central bank@@ 's decision to pro@@ p up their reserves with f@@ res@@ h in@@ jec@@ tions of credit rein@@ forced expect@@ ations that the fix@@ ed exchange rate was do@@ om@@ ed.
Wor@@ se still@@ , in order to compens@@ ate for the credit exp@@ ended on interven@@ tion, the monetary authorities hi@@ ked the bank@@ s@@ ' reser@@ ve require@@ ments for new deposi@@ ts, a measure that affec@@ ted mostly foreign banks who were recei@@ ving deposi@@ ts es@@ cap@@ ing from public bank@@ s.
Th@@ er@@ e@@ for@@ e, foreign banks, fear@@ ful of further intervention and@@ /@@ or con@@ fis@@ c@@ ation, ref@@ used to re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish their local subsi@@ di@@ ari@@ es@@ ' reserves (@@ th@@ us, the answer to the ques@@ tion, why did@@ n@@ 't foreign banks act as a l@@ ender of last res@@ or@@ t@@ ?@@ ).
This destro@@ yed what little confidence in the banking system rema@@ in@@ ed.
As foreign reserves continued to pl@@ um@@ me@@ t, the p@@ es@@ o@@ 's de@@ valu@@ ation became inevit@@ able.
W@@ ould Argentin@@ a be better off had it flo@@ ated the p@@ es@@ o long before all th@@ is@@ ?
Such a move might have prev@@ ented the p@@ es@@ o from becoming so over@@ valu@@ ed that investors lost confidence in the country's ability to pay its deb@@ ts.
But without a credi@@ ble monetary policy, flo@@ ating the currency would have merely st@@ ok@@ ed hy@@ per@@ infl@@ ation.
So the key lesson here is that the type of exchange rate regime is sec@@ on@@ dar@@ y to the credi@@ bility required to su@@ sta@@ in it.
C@@ lear@@ ly, he@@ ter@@ o@@ do@@ x monetary policy was far from credi@@ ble, and it turned out to be the main cul@@ pri@@ t behind Argentin@@ a's final collap@@ se.

The latest edi@@ tion of the Pe@@ w Global At@@ titu@@ des S@@ ur@@ v@@ ey shows that favor@@ able opini@@ ons of the United States have fallen again in 12 out of 15 countries pol@@ le@@ d, a sa@@ d reflec@@ tion of a country’s loss of ima@@ ge.
How can America reco@@ ver international legitim@@ ac@@ y?
This is probably one of the most important challenges for today’s world, for America re@@ tains a uni@@ que power that should be used – and be perceived – as a force for good if global stability is to prev@@ ail@@ .
N@@ early two decades after the de@@ mis@@ e of the Soviet emp@@ i@@ re, what stands out is a prev@@ ail@@ ing sense of lost opportuni@@ ties.
The US had a uni@@ que opportunity at the end of the Cold War to use its ben@@ evol@@ ent and en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed sup@@ eri@@ ority to establish a better international order@@ .
But, for a combin@@ ation of political and personal reason@@ s, America lost time under the two presiden@@ cies of Bill Clint@@ on.
Indeed, during this necess@@ arily short and fragi@@ le “@@ uni@@ pol@@ ar moment@@ ,” Clinton probably had an in@@ tu@@ ition of what America’s new responsi@@ bili@@ ties should be, but he did not deliver@@ .
The defe@@ at of the Democ@@ rats in the mid-@@ term elections in 199@@ 4, followed by the Mon@@ ic@@ a Le@@ w@@ ins@@ k@@ y affair@@ , ham@@ per@@ ed the effec@@ tiveness of one of America’s most en@@ er@@ ge@@ tic and gi@@ f@@ ted Pres@@ id@@ ents.
That failure was ep@@ it@@ om@@ ized by the in@@ ability to impose a peace agreement on Palestinians and Israelis in 200@@ 0.
By contrast, George W. Bush did not lose time.
He did wor@@ se@@ : he simply took a wrong turn – and he took it before 9@@ /@@ 1@@ 1, a trau@@ mati@@ c ev@@ ent that rein@@ forc@@ ed, but did not cre@@ ate, America’s Man@@ ich@@ e@@ an view of itself and its role in the world.
Th@@ re@@ e recent exam@@ ples illu@@ st@@ rate what went wrong with America, its loss of uni@@ que stat@@ us, and its growing ima@@ ge as a parti@@ s@@ an and un@@ eth@@ ic@@ al, if not destabili@@ z@@ ing, force in the world.
Consi@@ der, fir@@ st, the recent nuclear agreement signed between the US and Indi@@ a.
In stri@@ c@@ tly legal term@@ s, there is nothing wron@@ g, since India never signed the Nu@@ clear N@@ on-@@ Pro@@ lifer@@ ation Treat@@ y.
But in psych@@ ological and political term@@ s, the deal signed could only be perceived as legitim@@ iz@@ ing for Iran’s nuclear ambi@@ tions, not to men@@ tion North Kore@@ a@@ ’@@ s.
It was the ultim@@ ate pro@@ of that the Bush administration does not believe in universal norm@@ s.
A “@@ good@@ ” country would be tre@@ ated with extreme len@@ i@@ enc@@ y, whereas a “@@ b@@ ad@@ ” country would not.
Gu@@ ant@@ á@@ nam@@ o, Ab@@ u G@@ h@@ ra@@ i@@ b@@ , and more recent war@@ -@@ crimes sc@@ and@@ als have done much worse damage to America’s stat@@ u@@ re.
Regimes that systemati@@ cally viol@@ ate human rights have been qu@@ ick to sei@@ ze on every ep@@ is@@ o@@ de of US wron@@ g@@ do@@ ing.
With its own human rights record in ques@@ tion, the US, which had been the democratic teach@@ er of the post-@@ war world, is in a much weak@@ er position to give lessons and set standard@@ s.
Nor does the appear@@ ance of hy@@ po@@ cri@@ s@@ y end ther@@ e.
At a time when “@@ democrac@@ y” and “@@ democrati@@ z@@ ation@@ ” have become the wat@@ ch@@ wor@@ ds of US foreign policy, nor@@ mali@@ zation of diplomatic relations with G@@ addaf@@ i@@ ’s Liby@@ a, not to men@@ tion len@@ i@@ ency towards Egypt and Saudi Arabi@@ a hardly boo@@ sts America’s credi@@ bilit@@ y.
In global term@@ s, the contra@@ st between what America sa@@ ys and what it does has become g@@ lar@@ ing.
In Febru@@ ary 200@@ 5, in a major spe@@ e@@ ch in Par@@ is during her first foreign tri@@ p as Secretary of Stat@@ e, Con@@ d@@ ol@@ ee@@ zz@@ a Ri@@ ce st@@ ated America’s ambi@@ tion in the world.
S@@ he said essen@@ tially the follow@@ ing@@ : “@@ The role of the world is to improve the world.
America, as the most powerful and eth@@ ical country in the world, has a uni@@ que responsibility to per@@ form@@ .”
E@@ igh@@ te@@ en months later, the results are falling far short of the go@@ al.
On the contrary, the fail@@ ures of US policy have contribut@@ ed to reduce the legitimacy of America’s power fur@@ ther.
Despite the recent death of Z@@ ar@@ q@@ aw@@ i in Iraq, the situation ther@@ e, and in Afghanistan, does not justi@@ fy the continued Bush administ@@ ration@@ ’s optim@@ ism.
As America’s legitimacy dimin@@ ish@@ es, new ac@@ tors are appe@@ aring on the world stage – or retur@@ ning for an enc@@ or@@ e.
Russia and China today are un@@ ited not only by their energy de@@ als, but also by both countries’ con@@ vic@@ tion that their time has come, and that the outside world needs them more than they need the outside world, particularly the US.
In strategic term@@ s, the wan@@ ing influence of a par@@ aly@@ zed Europe is also very bad news for Americ@@ a.
The US needs allies now more than ever@@ , for the world is re@@ ver@@ ting to its pre-@@ war multi@@ -@@ pol@@ ar state.
Of course, given America’s objec@@ tive military sup@@ eri@@ or@@ ity, I would call it “@@ asy@@ mmet@@ ri@@ cal multi@@ -@@ pol@@ ar@@ it@@ y@@ .” But the US is no longer the country that others seek to em@@ ul@@ ate, or that they look to for global leader@@ ship.
It is too early to dis@@ mis@@ s America and proc@@ la@@ im the end of an imperi@@ al mom@@ ent.
America re@@ tains uni@@ que quali@@ ties – particularly its ability to re@@ bo@@ und@@ .
The next US president should be able to capit@@ alize on Americ@@ an@@ s’ fundamental optim@@ ism, pragmati@@ sm@@ , and activ@@ ism.
But he or she will face an up@@ h@@ ill struggle to prove to the world that America can be a force for go@@ od, a democratic be@@ ac@@ on that car@@ es for the plan@@ et and that lives up to the standards that it s@@ ets for others.
A lot of public attention and wor@@ ry nowad@@ a@@ ys sur@@ round@@ s the new risks that globalization and information technology create for our wages and li@@ v@@ eli@@ ho@@ od@@ s.
But there has been far less construc@@ tive discus@@ sion of new ideas about how to confron@@ t these risk@@ s.
In fact, we might be los@@ ing the moment@@ um we had a few years ago to imp@@ lement some of these ide@@ as.
To be sure, we still symp@@ ath@@ i@@ ze with people wh@@ o, upon reach@@ ing middle age or later, find themselves re@@ placed by lower@@ -@@ paid workers in another part of the world, if not by a compu@@ ter or a ro@@ bo@@ t.
But are we really going to do anything about these risk@@ s?
One new idea that seemed ho@@ t a few years ago is “@@ wage insur@@ anc@@ e.”
As then flo@@ ated, the idea was simp@@ le@@ : the government would protect people from the risk of los@@ ing their job and being unable to find a new one at the same wa@@ ge.
A government insurance program would pay these people a fra@@ c@@ tion, say, hal@@ f, the difference between their old pay and their pay in a new job for a speci@@ fied peri@@ od, such as two years.
The idea was first proposed by Robert Z@@ . L@@ aw@@ ren@@ ce and Robert L@@ it@@ an in their 198@@ 6 book@@ , Sa@@ ving Fre@@ e Tra@@ de, and@@ revi@@ ved in a 2001 ar@@ tic@@ le by L@@ it@@ an and L@@ or@@ i K@@ letz@@ er.
The proposal gener@@ ated interes@@ t.
A demon@@ stration program was adopted in the United States in 200@@ 2. In 200@@ 2, the Har@@ tz Commission re@@ commen@@ ded a ver@@ sion of it in German@@ y.
W@@ age insurance programs have been ac@@ tively tal@@ ked about or actually implement@@ ed in some form in Britain@@ , France, S@@ wi@@ tz@@ er@@ land, and I@@ rel@@ and.
Despite all the intellectual ap@@ pl@@ aus@@ e, however, wage insurance programs are still not a significant force in the world economy.
They should be.
But they should also be supp@@ lement@@ ed by other de@@ vic@@ es.
One advantage of wage insurance is that it may be a more effective way to subsi@@ di@@ ze on-@@ th@@ e-@@ job tra@@ ining than traditional government@@ -@@ run voc@@ ational tra@@ ining program@@ s.
O@@ f@@ ten, after comple@@ ting a government@@ -@@ sp@@ on@@ sor@@ ed progra@@ m, particip@@ ants find it impossible to secure a job with the promised higher pa@@ y.
F@@ ar bet@@ ter, pro@@ pon@@ ents of wage insurance argu@@ e, for the tra@@ ining to be car@@ ried out by an employ@@ er who wants a job done and knows what the employ@@ e@@ e needs to lear@@ n.
It seems plausi@@ ble that two years is long enough for re@@ tra@@ in@@ ing, after which the employ@@ e@@ e might comm@@ and a higher wage without a government sub@@ sid@@ y.
But government@@ s, fear@@ ing the exp@@ ense of wage insurance if a lot of people explo@@ it it, have not been willing to imp@@ lement it on a large sc@@ al@@ e.
For example, the US wage insurance program is con@@ fin@@ ed to manufacturing workers over age 50 who are in competi@@ tively vulnerable industri@@ es and are de@@ em@@ ed by the Secretary of Lab@@ or to have non@@ trans@@ fer@@ able skill@@ s.
Moreover, the benefit is c@@ app@@ ed at $@@ 5@@ ,000 per year.
The program has practic@@ ally been for@@ go@@ t@@ ten, and will exp@@ ire next year unless it is renew@@ ed.
With government deficits the nor@@ m, that appears un@@ lik@@ el@@ y.
The way to re@@ gain lost moment@@ um is to recognize that wage insurance is only one of several new ideas for insur@@ ing the emerging risks of this century.
The weak@@ ness of the current wage insurance proposal is that it pa@@ ys benefits only for a limited period and reli@@ es for its long-term effect on the re@@ tra@@ ining incentives that it cre@@ at@@ es.
In re@@ ality, however, los@@ ing a high-@@ pa@@ ying job may be a life@@ time ev@@ ent, and the supposed re@@ tra@@ ining that wage insurance would encourage for a la@@ id@@ -@@ off 50@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old work@@ er often may be in@@ effec@@ tive.
In my 2003 book@@ , New Financial Or@@ der@@ : R@@ is@@ k in the 2@@ 1@@ st Cent@@ ur@@ y, I proposed a different ide@@ a, which I called “@@ li@@ v@@ eli@@ hood insur@@ anc@@ e.”
As the name imp@@ li@@ es, li@@ v@@ eli@@ hood insurance is designed to provide more than just a bri@@ ef resp@@ ite or a sub@@ sid@@ y for re@@ tra@@ in@@ ing.
It is aimed at de@@ aling with long-term changes in the labor market, rather than ass@@ uring temporary wage level@@ s.
It would also rely on the market rather than a government program@@ .
With li@@ v@@ eli@@ hood insur@@ ance, a private insur@@ er would pay a stre@@ am of income to a policy@@ hol@@ der if an inde@@ x of average income in the in@@ su@@ red person@@ ’s occup@@ ation and region decl@@ ines substanti@@ ally.
Moreover, this income stre@@ am would continue for as long as the inde@@ x sta@@ ys dow@@ n, not just for a cou@@ ple of years (or any other ar@@ bit@@ r@@ ary peri@@ od@@ ).
In other words, this insurance policy would protect against life@@ time income risk@@ s.
One reason why government@@ -@@ run wage insurance programs must have limited du@@ ration is that they invol@@ ve so-called “@@ moral ha@@ z@@ ard@@ ”@@ : the risk that people will get la@@ z@@ y or would take easi@@ er, lower@@ -@@ pa@@ ying jobs and continue to collec@@ t insurance that pa@@ ys them the wage of a more dem@@ anding occup@@ ation.
But this would not app@@ ly to li@@ v@@ eli@@ hood insur@@ ance, because its benefits are ti@@ ed to the rise and fall of income indic@@ es, which are beyond the control of individu@@ als.
Li@@ v@@ eli@@ hood insurance would also have another advan@@ ta@@ ge.
Since the pre@@ mi@@ um would be determined by the market, it would be higher in occup@@ ations that the market believ@@ es to be in danger from out@@ sourc@@ ing or techni@@ cal change.
Th@@ is, in tur@@ n, would give workers a tan@@ gi@@ ble war@@ ning and an incen@@ tive to anti@@ cip@@ ate job losses before they occur@@ .
This is not to say that wage insurance is a bad ide@@ a, or that it should not be implement@@ ed on a wider sc@@ al@@ e.
Both wage and li@@ v@@ eli@@ hood insurance appear to have important risk management func@@ tions.
Indeed, for the futu@@ re, it is im@@ per@@ ative to think about many new way@@ s, invol@@ ving both government and the market, to ensure that we manage better the greatest personal risks now faced by workers around the world.
NEW YORK – Her@@ e’s a conc@@ ept you@@ ’@@ ve probably never hear@@ d of@@ : “@@ vi@@ ral sovereign@@ ty@@ .”
This dangerous idea comes to us cour@@ tes@@ y of Indonesi@@ a’s minister of heal@@ th, Sit@@ i F@@ adi@@ la@@ h Su@@ par@@ i, who asser@@ ts that de@@ adly vi@@ rus@@ es are the sovereign property of individual nations – even though they c@@ ross bor@@ ders and could pose a pan@@ dem@@ ic threat to all the world’s peop@@ l@@ es.
Politi@@ cal leaders around the world should take no@@ te – and take very strong ac@@ tion.
The vast majority of avi@@ an fl@@ u out@@ break@@ s in the past four years, in both hum@@ ans and p@@ oul@@ tr@@ y, have occur@@ red in Indonesi@@ a.
At least 5@@ 3 typ@@ es of H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 bir@@ d fl@@ u vi@@ rus@@ es have appe@@ ared in chi@@ ck@@ ens and people ther@@ e, according to the World He@@ al@@ th Organ@@ iz@@ ation.
Yet, since 200@@ 5, Indonesi@@ a has shared with the W@@ H@@ O sam@@ ples from only two of the more than 1@@ 3@@ 5 people known to have been infec@@ ted with H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 (@@ 1@@ 10 of whom have di@@ ed@@ ).
Wor@@ se, Indonesi@@ a is no longer providing the W@@ H@@ O with tim@@ ely no@@ ti@@ fication of bir@@ d fl@@ u out@@ break@@ s or human cas@@ es.
Since 2007, its government has open@@ ly de@@ fied international health regul@@ ations and a ho@@ st of other W@@ H@@ O agreements to which Indonesi@@ a is a sig@@ nat@@ or@@ y.
Moreover, Indonesi@@ a’s government is threat@@ ening to close down United States N@@ av@@ al Medi@@ cal Res@@ ear@@ ch Un@@ it Two (@@ NA@@ M@@ R@@ U@@ -@@ 2@@ ), a public health labor@@ atory st@@ aff@@ ed by Indonesi@@ ans and US military scienti@@ st@@ s.
NA@@ M@@ R@@ U@@ -@@ 2 is one of the world’s best disease surv@@ ei@@ ll@@ ance fac@@ ili@@ ties, providing health officials worldwide with vit@@ al, transpar@@ ent inform@@ ation.
Indonesi@@ a’s government has acc@@ used NA@@ M@@ R@@ U@@ -@@ 2 scientists of everything from prof@@ iting from its “@@ sovereign@@ ” vi@@ rus@@ es to manufacturing the H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 bir@@ d fl@@ u as part of an al@@ leg@@ ed bi@@ ological war@@ fare schem@@ e.
There is no evidence to support these out@@ lan@@ dis@@ h claim@@ s.
A year ago, Su@@ par@@ i@@ ’s asser@@ tions about “@@ vi@@ ral sovereign@@ ty@@ ” seemed an@@ om@@ al@@ ous.
Di@@ st@@ ur@@ b@@ ing@@ ly, however, the no@@ tion has mor@@ ph@@ ed into a global movem@@ ent, fuel@@ ed by self-@@ destruc@@ tive, anti-@@ Western senti@@ ments.
In Ma@@ y, Indian He@@ al@@ th Minister An@@ b@@ um@@ an@@ i R@@ am@@ ad@@ os@@ s end@@ or@@ sed the conc@@ ept in a disp@@ ute with Bang@@ lad@@ es@@ h@@ , and the N@@ on-@@ A@@ lig@@ ned Mo@@ vement – a 1@@ 1@@ 2-@@ nation organiz@@ ation that is a survi@@ vor of the Cold War era – has agreed to consider form@@ ally end@@ or@@ sing it at its November me@@ et@@ ing.
Indonesi@@ a argu@@ es that a nation@@ ’s right to control all information on lo@@ cally dis@@ cover@@ ed vi@@ rus@@ es should be protec@@ ted through the same mechanis@@ ms that the United Nations Fo@@ od and A@@ gri@@ culture Organ@@ ization uses to guarantee poor countries’ rights of owner@@ ship and pat@@ ents on the se@@ eds of its indi@@ gen@@ ous pl@@ ant@@ s.
Un@@ der the F@@ A@@ O se@@ ed acc@@ or@@ d, a nation can regi@@ ster pl@@ ant@@ s, share their se@@ ed@@ s, and deri@@ ve prof@@ its from resulting produc@@ ts.
This us@@ eful policy redu@@ ces explo@@ it@@ ative practi@@ ces that sometimes enable mul@@ tin@@ ational corpor@@ ations and weal@@ thy governments to ob@@ tain ou@@ tra@@ ge@@ ous prof@@ its from indi@@ gen@@ ous agri@@ cultu@@ re.
It is dangerous f@@ oll@@ y, however, to ex@@ tend this policy to vi@@ rus@@ es.
If the conc@@ ept of “@@ vi@@ ral sovereign@@ ty@@ ” had been app@@ lied to HI@@ V 25 years ago, we would not have central re@@ posi@@ tor@@ ies of thousands of v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties of HI@@ V toda@@ y; these allow scientists to test dru@@ gs and v@@ acc@@ ines against all the different stra@@ ins of the vi@@ ru@@ s that causes AIDS@@ .
It is even more lu@@ dic@@ ro@@ us to ex@@ tend the sovereign@@ ty no@@ tion to vi@@ rus@@ es that, like flu@@ , can be car@@ ried across international bor@@ ders by mig@@ rat@@ ory bir@@ ds.
In this age of globaliz@@ ation, failure to make vi@@ ral sam@@ ples fre@@ ely available risks allow@@ ing the emer@@ gence of a new stra@@ in of influ@@ enz@@ a that could go un@@ no@@ tic@@ ed until it is capable of exac@@ ting the sort of t@@ ol@@ l taken by the pan@@ dem@@ ic that killed tens of millions in 19@@ 18@@ .
As the world learned with the emer@@ gence of severe ac@@ ute resp@@ ir@@ atory syn@@ dro@@ me (@@ S@@ AR@@ S@@ ) – which first appe@@ ared in China in 2002 but was not repor@@ ted by Chinese officials until it spread to four other nations – glob@@ ally shared health risks demand absolu@@ te global transpar@@ enc@@ y.
There is strong evidence from a vari@@ ety of sources that forms of the bir@@ d fl@@ u vi@@ ru@@ s cir@@ cul@@ ating in Indonesi@@ a are more vi@@ rul@@ ent than those else@@ where and that in a few cases they may have spread directly from one person to an@@ other.
The W@@ H@@ O has tried for two years to ac@@ com@@ mod@@ ate Indonesi@@ a, without succ@@ ess.
Un@@ der pressure from scientists world@@ wi@@ de, Indonesi@@ a agreed in Jun@@ e to share genetic data on some of its vi@@ ral sam@@ pl@@ es, but not the ac@@ tual m@@ icro@@ bes@@ .
Without access to the vi@@ rus@@ es, it is impossible to ver@@ i@@ fy the acc@@ u@@ ra@@ cy of such genetic information or to develop v@@ acc@@ ines against the de@@ adly m@@ icro@@ bes@@ .
O@@ ut@@ ra@@ ge@@ ously, Su@@ par@@ i has charg@@ ed that the W@@ H@@ O would give any vi@@ rus@@ es – not just H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 – to drug compani@@ es, which in turn would make products designed to si@@ cken poor people, in order “@@ to pro@@ long their profit@@ able business by s@@ elling new v@@ acc@@ ines@@ ” (@@ a char@@ ge od@@ dly remin@@ is@@ cent of the p@@ lot of John le Car@@ r@@ é@@ ’s nov@@ el The Con@@ st@@ ant Gar@@ den@@ er ).
The W@@ H@@ O e@@ lic@@ ited p@@ led@@ ges from the world’s major drug companies not to explo@@ it international re@@ posi@@ tor@@ ies of genetic data for commercial benef@@ it, but this has not sati@@ s@@ fied Indonesi@@ a.
Indonesi@@ a’s claim that NA@@ M@@ R@@ U@@ -@@ 2 is a bi@@ ological weapons fac@@ ili@@ ty must be confron@@ ted head@@ -@@ on.
The US am@@ b@@ ass@@ ad@@ or to Indonesi@@ a, Cam@@ er@@ on Hum@@ e, is ac@@ tively trying to prevent a c@@ atastroph@@ e.
So f@@ ar, there has been in@@ sufficient support from senior US offici@@ als.
They must get invol@@ v@@ ed.
And China must use its substantial influence with Indonesi@@ a on this issue – in its own self-@@ interes@@ t.
F@@ ail@@ ure to share potentially pan@@ dem@@ ic vi@@ ral stra@@ ins with world health agen@@ cies is mor@@ ally re@@ preh@@ ensi@@ ble.
Al@@ low@@ ing Indonesi@@ a and other countries to turn this issue into another rich@@ -@@ po@@ or, Islam@@ ic@@ -@@ Western disp@@ ute would be tra@@ gi@@ c – and could lead to a dev@@ a@@ stat@@ ing health crisis any@@ where and at any time.
How do we jud@@ ge the quality of public servic@@ es?
That question is far tri@@ ck@@ ier than it appear@@ s.
In some cases the answer seems simple enough@@ : whether tra@@ ins run on time.
But is this really all we want from our tra@@ ins@@ ?
Su@@ rely not.
They should be saf@@ e, too, and reason@@ ably com@@ fort@@ able.
They should run not only on time, but at the right time and at reason@@ able inter@@ val@@ s.
More important still@@ , they should be aff@@ ord@@ able.
As the list of cri@@ ter@@ ia grow@@ s lon@@ ger, it becomes evi@@ dent that the most easily measu@@ red comp@@ on@@ ent, p@@ unc@@ tu@@ ality, is but one of many desi@@ ra@@ ble feat@@ ures, and not necess@@ arily the most signific@@ ant.
This example is relevant for the politics of public servic@@ es, which domin@@ ates debate in many countries because it lies at the heart of the big problems of both government budge@@ ts (and cutting them back@@ ) and taxes (and their reduc@@ tion@@ ).
In ke@@ eping with the spiri@@ t of the tim@@ es, governments intro@@ duce business cri@@ ter@@ ia for meas@@ uring the effici@@ enc@@ y-@@ -@@ and the "@@ success@@ ," more gener@@ all@@ y-@@ -@@ of public servic@@ es.
This me@@ ans, above all, that they set performance targe@@ ts.
So ministers proc@@ la@@ im that stre@@ et cri@@ me will be hal@@ ved by next spr@@ ing, or that the propor@@ tion of each generation going to universi@@ ties will be raised to 50% in five years. W@@ a@@ iting li@@ sts for hospit@@ al be@@ ds will be cut by one-@@ third within two years.
This metho@@ d of governance makes it appear that, at long la@@ st, we can hold politicians accoun@@ table by establish@@ ing whether targe@@ ts have been reached or not.
But is this what we really w@@ ant@@ ?
The exam@@ ples just given are taken from real life.
In real lif@@ e, however, performance targe@@ ts also have c@@ uri@@ ous side effec@@ ts.
C@@ ut@@ ting hospit@@ al wa@@ iting li@@ sts has led doc@@ tors to tre@@ at min@@ or ill@@ n@@ esses more quick@@ ly, leaving those with more serious conditions off the li@@ sts al@@ toge@@ ther.
The rapid increase in universi@@ ty students has led to decl@@ ines in ad@@ mission standards and the quality of final degre@@ es.
R@@ educ@@ ing stre@@ et cri@@ me encoura@@ ged the police to stop regi@@ ster@@ ing certain off@@ ens@@ es al@@ toge@@ ther.
In shor@@ t, because the avail@@ ability of government support depends on achiev@@ ing seem@@ ingly prec@@ ise targe@@ ts, the incen@@ tive to a@@ im for appar@@ ent rather than real success becomes an almost overwhelm@@ ing temp@@ t@@ ation.
Moreover, many public services are so-called "@@ soft servic@@ es@@ ."
Ho@@ spit@@ al care ent@@ ail@@ s much more than a well-@@ func@@ tioning con@@ ve@@ y@@ or bel@@ t for sur@@ gi@@ cal oper@@ ations.
E@@ duc@@ ation is in all cases about more than achiev@@ ing a certain "@@ through@@ put@@ ."
Social services generally need time, not least the time of car@@ egi@@ ver@@ s, and their time is often required in un@@ predict@@ able bur@@ st@@ s@@ --@@ a fact ut@@ ter@@ ly at od@@ ds with targe@@ t-@@ mani@@ a.
Ob@@ vi@@ ously, public money must not be wa@@ st@@ ed.
But, even her@@ e, questions ar@@ is@@ e.
Consider publi@@ cl@@ y-@@ f@@ unded scientific resear@@ ch.
It is in the nature of such research that it proc@@ e@@ eds by tri@@ al and er@@ ror@@ .
For every road to new dis@@ cover@@ i@@ es, there will be several negative results and cul@@ -@@ de-@@ sac@@ s.
If only highly targe@@ ted research with guarante@@ ed success is f@@ un@@ ded, the prob@@ ability must be high that innov@@ ative resear@@ ch@@ ers em@@ ig@@ rate to countries or institutions that have a more gener@@ ous and appropriate approach to the relationship between funding and succ@@ ess.
While all this may be tru@@ e, the question rema@@ ins@@ : how do we make s@@ ure that public services are run with reason@@ able effici@@ ency and produce the results inten@@ ded by governments and expected by taxpay@@ er@@ s?
One answer has to do with in@@ put rather than out@@ com@@ es@@ --@@ that is, with the quality and e@@ tho@@ s of those running our public services and working in them.
H@@ ere the business an@@ alo@@ g@@ y is simply not suffici@@ ent.
The old French administ@@ rative tra@@ ining for public services tau@@ ght both relevant skill@@ s and an e@@ tho@@ s of civi@@ c commit@@ ment.
The old civil service in countries like Britain or Germany emb@@ rac@@ ed an approach to their t@@ as@@ ks that made it a matter of hon@@ or to per@@ form well.
Sel@@ f-@@ interest and char@@ ity are not the only human mo@@ tiv@@ ations@@ ; there is also the mo@@ tive of servic@@ e, and it needs to be cul@@ tiv@@ ated.
At the other end@@ --@@ that of resul@@ ts@@ --@@ some targe@@ ts do make sen@@ se.
Tra@@ ins should run on time.
But beyond that is the human jud@@ g@@ ment of those most affec@@ ted.
This is why par@@ ents@@ ' coun@@ c@@ il@@ s for school@@ s, or commit@@ te@@ es of us@@ ers of public tran@@ spor@@ t, or pati@@ ents@@ ' bo@@ ards for hospit@@ als are cru@@ ci@@ al.
Such bo@@ dies may seem weak at first si@@ gh@@ t.
They may even be regar@@ ded as a nu@@ is@@ ance by profession@@ als.
In fact, however, they provide an inv@@ al@@ u@@ able ch@@ ec@@ k on s@@ lo@@ pp@@ y and in@@ efficient provi@@ ders of public servic@@ es.
We must bew@@ are of over@@ ly business@@ -@@ gu@@ ided approach@@ es to public servic@@ e.
At certain times and in certain countries, services that need not be public had to be privati@@ zed and run along business lines in order to make them run bet@@ ter@@ --@@ or to keep them running at all.
But core public services in heal@@ th, education, tran@@ spor@@ t, and a few other areas will for@@ ever be just that, services , and will therefore need to be appreci@@ ated in more complex ways than meeting measu@@ ra@@ ble targe@@ ts.

Some of these powers are still emerging economies.
Politi@@ call@@ y, however, most of them have cros@@ sed the th@@ res@@ hold that has long limited their access to the k@@ it@@ chen of international decision@@ -@@ mak@@ ing.
The five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (the “@@ P@@ -@@ 5@@ ”@@ ) still def@@ end their right to ve@@ to res@@ olu@@ tions, and their military power is un@@ mat@@ ch@@ ed.
But they can no longer dis@@ pose of sufficient resourc@@ es, comp@@ et@@ ence, and legitimacy to co@@ pe with global challenges or crises on their ow@@ n.
Bi@@ pol@@ arity is a thing of the past@@ , and it is unlikely to re-@@ emer@@ ge in a new Sin@@ o-@@ American “@@ G-@@ 2@@ .”
It is equally unlikely for the for@@ es@@ ee@@ able future that any one clu@@ b of countries, such as the G-@@ 7 or G-@@ 8, will again assu@@ me a qu@@ asi@@ -@@ he@@ gemon@@ ic posi@@ tion.
Even the G-20 in its current com@@ position may not really repres@@ ent the forces that can and will shap@@ e the twent@@ y-@@ first century.
For the Un@@ it@@ es States, the European Union, Japan, and other members of the “@@ O@@ ld West@@ ,” the good news is that most of the emerging powers that are posi@@ tioning themselves for a more active global role are also democra@@ cies.
Wi@@ thin the G-@@ 20@@ , only two states – China and Saudi Arabi@@ a – exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly do not want to be liberal democra@@ cies, while a thir@@ d, Russia, has developed into an auto@@ cra@@ cy with a democratic fa@@ ç@@ a@@ de.
The no@@ t-@@ so-@@ good news is that these new democratic powers do not necess@@ arily share the O@@ ld West@@ ’s political agenda@@ .
For example, they diff@@ er about climate policies, se@@ eing a threat to development.
Similarly, while new middle and great powers do not always agre@@ e, they are generally more skep@@ tical of both international sanctions and military interven@@ tions.
Moreover, some of the most important of these states diff@@ er substanti@@ ally with the US, and often also with the EU, about the right approach toward regional conflic@@ ts, especially in the Middle East@@ .
Thus, in 201@@ 0, the US found itself in a serious diplomatic disp@@ ute with Turkey and Brazi@@ l about how to resol@@ ve the conflict with Iran over its nuclear program@@ .
Without actually ad@@ mit@@ ting it, the US was clearly un@@ happ@@ y that these two states tried to play a diplomatic role of their own in the disp@@ u@@ te.
Di@@ ff@@ er@@ ences are also appar@@ ent where new democratic middle or great powers have form@@ ed new groups or cl@@ ub@@ s, such as the BR@@ IC@@ S@@ , together with non-@@ democratic power@@ s.
India, Braz@@ il, and South Africa are using such form@@ ats in a pragmati@@ c way to pursue their interest@@ s, or simply to demon@@ st@@ rate their increased international wei@@ gh@@ t.
There is little agreement between them and Russia or China – both P@@ -@@ 5 members – with regard to political values or to fundamental questions of international order@@ .
Al@@ ong with many other states in the global Sou@@ th, however, Russia and China tend to def@@ end the principle of non-@@ inter@@ fer@@ ence, and they are generally rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ant to support any US or European attemp@@ ts to project democracy or def@@ end human rights in other countries.
Not a few policymakers in the US and in Europe have reac@@ ted with ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ment, or even anno@@ y@@ ance, to these emerging democratic power@@ s’ attemp@@ ts to pursue their own agen@@ das on the world sta@@ ge.
Such re@@ actions partly reflect old thinking roo@@ ted in the Cold W@@ ar, when democratic countries might diff@@ er over de@@ tail@@ s, but would agree about the main questions of international politics.
Those who pursu@@ ed a different agenda on substantial matters were either not part of the “@@ democratic camp@@ ” or were not important international play@@ ers.
By contrast, a central feat@@ ure of today’s globaliz@@ ed, multi@@ pol@@ ar world is that shared democratic values do not guarantee agreement about substantial questions of international politics.
The more democracies there are, the more conflic@@ ts of interests and differences are likely to emer@@ ge between democratic countries.
There is little reason to re@@ act with anger when states like Turke@@ y, Braz@@ il, and South Africa set priori@@ ties different from those of Europe or the US, or have different views about how to deal with the Arab@@ -@@ Israeli conflic@@ t, Iran, development ai@@ d, democracy promo@@ tion, or environmental protec@@ tion.
The US example shows clearly that democratic great powers often pursue their interests with little regard for a global common good that others have defin@@ ed.
In other words, the international order is becoming more pl@@ u@@ rali@@ sti@@ c.
The task for established Western democracies is to accept and co@@ pe with such “@@ democratic differ@@ enc@@ es” on the international level@@ , and to seek multilateral co@@ ali@@ tions to manage or solve problems.
In princip@@ le, the EU is better posi@@ tioned than the US (and certainly than Chin@@ a@@ ) to take on this t@@ as@@ k.
Europeans are well practic@@ ed in de@@ aling with differences and shap@@ ing consensus among princip@@ ally lik@@ e-@@ min@@ ded states.
That sa@@ id, Europe needs to learn to be cle@@ ar@@ er and more transpar@@ ent about the interests underlying its own policies, rather than suggest@@ ing that its posi@@ tions on a specific subject repres@@ ent the only rational implement@@ ation of democratic values and norm@@ s.
PR@@ IN@@ CE@@ T@@ ON – Of all the argum@@ ents against vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary eu@@ th@@ an@@ asi@@ a, the most influ@@ ential is the “@@ s@@ li@@ p@@ per@@ y s@@ lo@@ pe@@ ”@@ : once we allow doc@@ tors to k@@ ill pati@@ ents, we will not be able to limit the kill@@ ing to those who want to di@@ e.
There is no evidence for this claim@@ , even after many years of legal physi@@ ci@@ an-@@ assi@@ sted su@@ ici@@ de or vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary eu@@ th@@ an@@ asi@@ a in the Ne@@ ther@@ land@@ s, Bel@@ gi@@ um, Lu@@ x@@ em@@ bo@@ ur@@ g, S@@ wi@@ tz@@ er@@ land, and the American state of O@@ reg@@ on.
But recent re@@ vel@@ ations about what took place in a New Or@@ le@@ ans hospit@@ al after H@@ ur@@ ri@@ can@@ e Kat@@ rin@@ a point to a genu@@ ine danger from a different sourc@@ e.
When New Or@@ le@@ ans was flo@@ o@@ ded in August 200@@ 5, the rising water cut off M@@ em@@ ori@@ al Medi@@ cal Cent@@ er, a community hospit@@ al that was holding more than 200 pati@@ ents.
Th@@ re@@ e days after the hur@@ ri@@ can@@ e h@@ it, the hospit@@ al had no electric@@ ity, the water supply had fai@@ le@@ d, and to@@ i@@ le@@ ts could no longer be flus@@ h@@ ed.
Some pati@@ ents who were dependent on ven@@ ti@@ lat@@ ors di@@ ed.
In sti@@ fl@@ ing he@@ at, doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses were har@@ d-@@ pressed to care for survi@@ ving pati@@ ents lying on so@@ il@@ ed bed@@ s.
Ad@@ ding to the an@@ xi@@ ety were fear@@ s that law and order had bro@@ ken down in the c@@ ity, and that the hospit@@ al itself might be a target for armed ban@@ di@@ ts.
H@@ eli@@ co@@ p@@ ters were called in to ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ate pati@@ ents.
Pri@@ ority was given to those who were in better heal@@ th, and could wal@@ k.
State police ar@@ ri@@ ved and told st@@ af@@ f that because of the civil un@@ res@@ t, every@@ body had to be out of the hospit@@ al by 5 p@@ .@@ m.
On the ei@@ gh@@ th flo@@ or, J@@ anni@@ e Bur@@ ges@@ s, a 7@@ 9@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old wom@@ an with advanced canc@@ er, was on a mor@@ p@@ hin@@ e dri@@ p and close to de@@ a@@ th.
To ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ate her@@ , she would have to be car@@ ried down six f@@ ligh@@ ts of sta@@ ir@@ s, and would require the attention of n@@ ur@@ ses who were needed elsewher@@ e.
But if she were left un@@ atten@@ ded, she might come out of her s@@ ed@@ ation, and be in pain@@ .
E@@ wing Co@@ ok@@ , one of the physi@@ ci@@ ans pres@@ ent, in@@ struc@@ ted the n@@ ur@@ se to increase the mor@@ p@@ hin@@ e, “@@ giving her enough until she go@@ es@@ .”
It w@@ as, he later told S@@ her@@ i Fin@@ k, who recently publi@@ shed an account of these events in The New York Tim@@ es , a “@@ no@@ -@@ bra@@ in@@ er@@ .”
According to Fin@@ k, Ann@@ a P@@ ou@@ , another physi@@ ci@@ an, told n@@ ur@@ sing st@@ af@@ f that several pati@@ ents on the se@@ v@@ enth flo@@ or were also too ill to survi@@ ve.
S@@ he in@@ jec@@ ted them with mor@@ p@@ hin@@ e and another drug that slow@@ ed their bre@@ a@@ thing until they di@@ ed.
At least one of the pati@@ ents in@@ jec@@ ted with this le@@ th@@ al combin@@ ation of dru@@ gs appears to have other@@ wise been in little danger of im@@ min@@ ent de@@ a@@ th. E@@ mmet@@ t E@@ ver@@ et@@ t was a 6@@ 1@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old man who had been par@@ aly@@ zed in an ac@@ ci@@ dent several years ear@@ li@@ er, and was in the hospit@@ al for sur@@ ger@@ y to re@@ lie@@ ve a bo@@ we@@ l ob@@ struc@@ tion.
When others from his ward were ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated, he asked not to be left behin@@ d.
But he wei@@ gh@@ ed 3@@ 8@@ 0 po@@ und@@ s (@@ 17@@ 3 k@@ il@@ o@@ gra@@ m@@ s@@ ), and it would have been extrem@@ ely difficult to carry him down the sta@@ ir@@ s and then up again to where the he@@ li@@ co@@ p@@ ters were land@@ ing.
He was told the in@@ jec@@ tion he was being given would help with the di@@ z@@ zin@@ ess from which he suff@@ er@@ ed.
In 195@@ 7, a group of doc@@ tors asked Pop@@ e Pi@@ us X@@ II whether it is per@@ missi@@ ble to use nar@@ co@@ tics to sup@@ press pa@@ in and con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness “@@ if one for@@ es@@ e@@ es that the use of nar@@ co@@ tics will shor@@ ten life@@ .”
The Pop@@ e said that it w@@ as.
In its Dec@@ lar@@ ation on E@@ u@@ th@@ an@@ asi@@ a , issu@@ ed in 198@@ 0, the V@@ ati@@ can re@@ aff@@ ir@@ m@@ ed that view@@ .
The V@@ ati@@ can@@ ’s position is an app@@ lic@@ ation of what is known as “the doc@@ tr@@ ine of dou@@ ble effec@@ t@@ .”
An action that has two effec@@ ts, one good and the other b@@ ad, may be per@@ missi@@ ble if the good effect is the one that is inten@@ ded and the bad effect is merely an un@@ wanted consequ@@ ence of achiev@@ ing the good effec@@ t.
S@@ ig@@ ni@@ fic@@ antly, neither the Pop@@ e’s remark@@ s, nor the Dec@@ lar@@ ation on E@@ u@@ th@@ an@@ asi@@ a , place any empha@@ sis on the importance of ob@@ tain@@ ing the vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary and inform@@ ed con@@ sent of pati@@ ents, where possi@@ ble, before shor@@ ten@@ ing their li@@ ves.
According to the doc@@ tr@@ ine of dou@@ ble effec@@ t, two doc@@ tors ma@@ y, to all out@@ ward appear@@ ances, do exac@@ tly the same th@@ ing@@ : that is, they may give pati@@ ents in identi@@ cal conditions an identi@@ cal do@@ se of mor@@ p@@ hin@@ e, know@@ ing that this do@@ se will shor@@ ten the pati@@ ent@@ ’s life. Yet one doc@@ tor, who inten@@ ds to re@@ lie@@ ve the pati@@ ent@@ ’s pain@@ , ac@@ ts in acc@@ ord@@ ance with good medical practic@@ e, whereas the o@@ ther, who inten@@ ds to shor@@ ten the pati@@ ent@@ ’s lif@@ e, comm@@ its mur@@ der.
D@@ r@@ . Co@@ ok had little time for such sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties.
Only “@@ a very n@@ a@@ ï@@ ve doc@@ tor@@ ” would think that giving a person a lot of mor@@ p@@ hin@@ e was not “@@ pre@@ mat@@ u@@ rely sen@@ ding them to their gra@@ ve@@ ,” he told Fin@@ k, and then bl@@ un@@ tly ad@@ de@@ d@@ : “@@ We k@@ ill ‘@@ em@@ .”
In Co@@ ok@@ ’s opini@@ on, the line between something eth@@ ical and something il@@ legal is “@@ so fin@@ e as to be im@@ percei@@ v@@ able@@ .”
At M@@ em@@ ori@@ al Medi@@ cal Cent@@ er, physi@@ ci@@ ans and n@@ ur@@ ses found themselves under great pressu@@ re.
Ex@@ hau@@ sted after 7@@ 2 ho@@ urs with little sle@@ ep@@ , and stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing to care for their pati@@ ents, they were not in the best position to make difficult eth@@ ical decision@@ s.
The doc@@ tr@@ ine of dou@@ ble effec@@ t, proper@@ ly under@@ sto@@ od, does not justi@@ fy what the doc@@ tors did@@ ; bu@@ t, by in@@ uring them to the practi@@ ce of shor@@ ten@@ ing pati@@ ent@@ s’ lives without ob@@ tain@@ ing con@@ s@@ ent, it seems to have pa@@ ved the way for inten@@ tional kill@@ ing.
Rom@@ an C@@ atholi@@ c think@@ ers have been among the most vo@@ cal in in@@ vo@@ king the “@@ s@@ li@@ p@@ per@@ y s@@ lo@@ pe@@ ” argument against the leg@@ alization of vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary eu@@ th@@ an@@ asi@@ a and physi@@ ci@@ an-@@ assi@@ sted dy@@ ing.
They would do well to exam@@ ine the consequences of their own doc@@ tr@@ in@@ es.
NEW YORK – The US dollar is pl@@ ung@@ ing, the economy is imp@@ lo@@ d@@ ing, and a crisis of identi@@ ty is sh@@ aking countries around the world.
So, what are Americans ob@@ s@@ essed with at this critical moment@@ ?
“@@ Oc@@ t@@ am@@ om@@ ”@@ : the sag@@ a of N@@ ad@@ y@@ a Su@@ le@@ man, a young single mo@@ ther in L@@ os Angel@@ es wh@@ o, having already given bir@@ th to se@@ ven childr@@ en, under@@ went fer@@ ti@@ lity treat@@ ments and is now bringing home oc@@ tu@@ p@@ le@@ ts.
The story would ordin@@ arily be a m@@ ere c@@ uri@@ o@@ si@@ ty.
But, ever since Su@@ le@@ man hit the news stre@@ am@@ , do@@ z@@ ens of media out@@ le@@ ts have be@@ gu@@ n to repor@@ t, with a kind of ob@@ s@@ essive re@@ vul@@ sion, on her every mo@@ ve.
And, as if being called “@@ Oc@@ t@@ am@@ om@@ ” wer@@ en@@ ’t bad enough@@ , po@@ p star@@ s such as Ch@@ er have come forward to den@@ oun@@ ce her@@ ; blo@@ gs have been created to tra@@ ck the de@@ tail@@ s of her pl@@ as@@ tic sur@@ ger@@ y; and enter@@ tain@@ ment W@@ eb si@@ tes have sent repor@@ ters to stal@@ k her and wri@@ te sh@@ am@@ ing ex@@ pos@@ é@@ s of her so@@ j@@ our@@ n at an exp@@ ensive co@@ s@@ me@@ tics counter@@ .
It is true that there is pl@@ ent@@ y to condem@@ n@@ : Su@@ le@@ man@@ ’s family lives on food st@@ amp@@ s, the children already at home don’t have enough bab@@ y fur@@ nit@@ u@@ re, and her own par@@ ents are giving inter@@ views to the media in which they cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ ze her choic@@ es.
H@@ er public@@ ist qu@@ it, call@@ ing her “@@ cra@@ zy@@ .”
There have been pl@@ ent@@ y of od@@ d@@ ball fl@@ ash@@ -@@ in-@@ th@@ e-@@ p@@ an media star@@ s in US popular culture before Su@@ le@@ man@@ .
But her story just goes on and on, and the emo@@ tion that att@@ ach@@ es to it seems stran@@ gely fu@@ ri@@ ous and ven@@ gef@@ ul@@ .
I believe that Americ@@ an@@ s’ ob@@ s@@ ession with Su@@ le@@ man is a projec@@ tion of their own gu@@ il@@ t and sh@@ ame at their recent choic@@ es.
Su@@ le@@ man does not have a dec@@ ent job@@ , but she managed to invest in cost@@ ly fer@@ ti@@ lity treat@@ ments and could afford many exp@@ ensive co@@ s@@ me@@ tic sur@@ geri@@ es.
Wor@@ se ye@@ t, her sur@@ geri@@ es seem designed to make her res@@ em@@ ble the ac@@ t@@ ress Angel@@ in@@ a J@@ oli@@ e.
S@@ he som@@ eh@@ ow has a sp@@ aci@@ ous hous@@ e, but no pro@@ per be@@ ds for the k@@ id@@ s.
In other tim@@ es, it would have been the absence of a man that turned Su@@ le@@ man into an ob@@ ject of public s@@ cor@@ n.
Today, that scar@@ c@@ ely regi@@ st@@ ers against the other them@@ es: a@@  @@ work@@ ing-@@ class or unemploy@@ ed person dar@@ ed to asp@@ ire to res@@ em@@ ble some@@ one of too high a stat@@ us, and spent too much mon@@ ey@@  @@ conc@@ ei@@ ving too many blam@@ eless bab@@ ies who deser@@ ve protection and car@@ e, and who have now been put at risk by their mo@@ ther@@ ’s sel@@ fis@@ h choic@@ es.
Be@@ wit@@ ched by sym@@ bol@@ s of aff@@ lu@@ ence and a level of consumption that she@@  @@ could not aff@@ or@@ d, she ac@@ ted like a chil@@ d her@@ self@@ , with no thought to the future.
So@@ und famili@@ ar@@ ?
So@@ und like anyone you know@@ ?
R@@ ight now, Americans are stag@@ gering from the reality of what they themselves have don@@ e.
The real est@@ ate bub@@ ble infl@@ ated and collap@@ sed partly because millions of Americans borrow@@ ed more than they could afford to re@@ pay – and k@@ new it.
It takes nothing away from the pa@@ in of those now los@@ ing their hous@@ es to no@@ ti@@ ce that something od@@ dly American and a b@@ it per@@ verse happ@@ en@@ ed@@ : millions of Americans were s@@ educ@@ ed by fan@@ ta@@ si@@ es of a be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful big hous@@ e, v@@ ague about their own plans for the futu@@ re, and yet full of@@  @@ cra@@ z@@ y confi@@ den@@ c@@ e@@  @@ that it would all som@@ eh@@ ow work out.
American optim@@ ism became as much a cur@@ se as a bl@@ ess@@ ing.
The credit fre@@ e@@ ze is partly the work of bank@@ ers and h@@ ed@@ ge f@@ und manag@@ ers who ac@@ ted just like N@@ ad@@ y@@ a Su@@ le@@ man, lever@@ aging the present for an un@@ re@@ aliz@@ able future.
But it is also the result of ordinary Americ@@ ans, who ra@@ n up more credit car@@ d debt th@@ an@@  @@ any previous gener@@ ation.
In the m@@ all, or at home on the Inter@@ net, Americans ac@@ ted like N@@ ad@@ y@@ a Su@@ le@@ man, to@@ o@@ : s@@ educ@@ ed by the b@@ ag@@ , the sho@@ es, the be@@ au@@ ty treat@@ ments, the v@@ ac@@ ations, and the life that the star@@ s they ad@@ m@@ ire take for gran@@ ted.
And, with education and health care fal@@ ter@@ ing and social security funding at ris@@ k, their k@@ id@@ s, like Su@@ le@@ man@@ ’@@ s, are now end@@ an@@ ger@@ ed partly because of their own choic@@ es.
The manage@@ able, hon@@ or@@ able American D@@ re@@ am of the 19@@ 50@@ ’s – a de@@ cent@@ , aff@@ ord@@ able colle@@ ge educ@@ ation@@ ; a small house of one’s ow@@ n@@ ; hope that one’s children will be better off than on@@ es@@ el@@ f – was mis@@ placed in the last decade and a hal@@ f.
In the new@@ , re@@ alit@@ y-@@ show ver@@ sion of that dre@@ am@@ , coun@@ t@@ less Americans came to@@  @@ expect to be able to li@@ ve, look@@ , d@@ ance, and party like cel@@ eb@@ ri@@ ties, or el@@ se feel themselves to be fail@@ ur@@ es.
En@@ ough is not enough any@@ more.
That is the American D@@ re@@ am that N@@ ad@@ y@@ a Su@@ le@@ man b@@ ought in@@ to@@ , and, in their ob@@ s@@ ession with her@@ , Americans are coming to gri@@ ps with how seri@@ ously they went ast@@ ra@@ y.
Indeed, a@@  @@ st@@ range sense of re@@ lief is now cre@@ eping into Americ@@ an@@ s’ con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness as the consumer economy gr@@ in@@ ds to a hal@@ t.
The re@@ lief comes from not asp@@ iring to@@  @@ spend like Su@@ le@@ man, or B@@ rit@@ ney Spe@@ ar@@ s, or the neighbor@@ s down the stre@@ et.
It comes from the thought that this really might be@@  @@ enough to be able to afford a small hous@@ e, a colle@@ ge education, and the children that one already h@@ as.
Not long ago, an American political analy@@ st compared Franc@@ e’s loss of influence in Europe following its “@@ No@@ ” vote in the 2005 refer@@ endum on the EU constitutional treaty with Franc@@ e’s sur@@ ren@@ der in 194@@ 0.
A pro@@ voc@@ ative an@@ alo@@ g@@ y, but is it ap@@ t?
The collapse in 194@@ 0 reve@@ aled the fragi@@ lity of Franc@@ e’s democracy and its loss of confidence in the country’s capacity to face outside threat@@ s.
In rejec@@ ting the European constitu@@ tion, France ex@@ pressed its fear of@@ , among other th@@ ings, globaliz@@ ation.
A better an@@ alo@@ g@@ y for the No vote was the rejec@@ tion in 195@@ 4 of the treaty to establish a European Def@@ ense Commun@@ ity (@@ E@@ D@@ C@@ ).
In both cas@@ es, a major historical mist@@ ake was ma@@ de.
France had to a large extent initi@@ ated both tre@@ ati@@ es, had managed to get them accepted by its European partn@@ ers, but in the end v@@ et@@ o@@ ed its own under@@ tak@@ ings.
Wh@@ y, in both 195@@ 4 and 200@@ 5, did the French – in one case the National As@@ sem@@ b@@ ly, in the other the elector@@ ate – re@@ ject propos@@ als that France itself had conc@@ ei@@ v@@ ed@@ ?
Both projects sought to construc@@ t a genu@@ in@@ ely sup@@ ran@@ ational Europe.
The E@@ D@@ C would have created a European arm@@ y, in which even German troops would have been inclu@@ ded.
The proposed defense treaty was also to be but@@ t@@ res@@ sed by plans for a European political community whose main feat@@ ures were to be defin@@ ed by a constitutional com@@ mission made up of members of national parliament@@ s.
In effec@@ t, this com@@ mission would have been the prec@@ ur@@ s@@ or to the 200@@ 3@@ -@@ 2004 Con@@ vention for the F@@ ut@@ ure of Europe, wh@@ ich, pres@@ ided over by former French President V@@ al@@ é@@ ry G@@ is@@ car@@ d d@@ ’@@ E@@ sta@@ ing dra@@ f@@ ted the constitutional treat@@ y.
The political community of the 19@@ 50@@ ’s that France had persu@@ aded its five European partn@@ ers to accept was supposed to ab@@ sor@@ b both the European Co@@ al and S@@ te@@ el Commun@@ ity and the E@@ D@@ C@@ .
It was to have both diplomatic and military power@@ s, as well as a legisl@@ ative ass@@ em@@ bly much like today’s European Parli@@ ament – just as the 2005 EU constitutional plan would have exten@@ ded the European Parli@@ ament@@ ’s powers and created a European minister of foreign affair@@ s.
But now, as back then, fear and doubt won the da@@ y.
Politi@@ cal parties and others who mobili@@ zed opposition to the E@@ D@@ C fear@@ ed a re@@ milit@@ ari@@ zed Germany and a threat to Franc@@ e’s sovereign@@ ty.
Today, those in France who op@@ posed the EU constitu@@ tion succ@@ ee@@ ded in sti@@ gmati@@ zing “@@ Europe@@ ” as the threat@@ .
They tru@@ mp@@ et@@ ed Franc@@ e’s inv@@ asion by “@@ Poli@@ sh pl@@ um@@ ber@@ s@@ ,” call@@ ing into question Europe’s two princip@@ al achiev@@ em@@ ent@@ s: the introduc@@ tion of a single market, which has unden@@ i@@ ably boo@@ sted the French economy, and EU enlar@@ ge@@ ment, which has done so much to fo@@ ster democratic transition in new member states.
But the failure of the refer@@ endum in France car@@ ries more serious consequences than the E@@ D@@ C@@ ’s rejec@@ tion.
B@@ ack in the 195@@ 0’s, the found@@ ing nation@@ s’ foreign ministers pro@@ mp@@ tly turned to their Bel@@ gi@@ an colle@@ agu@@ e, P@@ aul@@ -@@ H@@ en@@ ri Sp@@ a@@ ak@@ , for f@@ res@@ h propos@@ als.
After inten@@ sive discus@@ sion among the si@@ x@@ , and especially between France and Germany, the Treaty of R@@ ome was draw@@ n up and signed within two years of the E@@ D@@ C deb@@ ac@@ le.
By contrast, two years after the French and D@@ ut@@ ch No vo@@ t@@ es, there is no sign of a Plan B@@ , despite the claims of the French politicians who helped mobili@@ ze the No vo@@ te. Europe’s Fran@@ co-@@ German lo@@ com@@ o@@ tive has bro@@ ken down and rati@@ fication has stopp@@ ed, even though member states that had yet to rati@@ fy the treaty could have comple@@ ted the process of rati@@ fic@@ ation.
Franc@@ e’s loss of influence in Europe is no longer at st@@ ake today, because the no@@ tion of influence pres@@ up@@ poses that the over@@ ri@@ ding pre@@ occup@@ ation of EU member states is to adv@@ ance their own national interest@@ s.
If Europe were only about gain@@ ing the u@@ pp@@ er hand, it would generate per@@ pet@@ ual conflic@@ t.
The reality is that Europe does manage to move ahe@@ ad, but step by step through mut@@ ual com@@ promis@@ e.
The real question has more to do with Franc@@ e’s credi@@ bility and its capacity to remain a dri@@ ving force in Europe.
A journ@@ alist recently ex@@ pressed the view that Franc@@ e’s special role in Europe was due to its “@@ cent@@ rali@@ ty@@ ,” mean@@ ing that the French are, in equal measu@@ re, both open to the world and att@@ ach@@ ed to their nation@@ . They also particip@@ ate success@@ fully in a market economy while seeking to preser@@ ve an eg@@ alit@@ arian social model@@ .
The No vote sul@@ lied this ima@@ ge of a bal@@ anced Fran@@ ce.
Indeed, the French themselves are among the first to lam@@ ent their ble@@ ak situ@@ ation, inv@@ enting a new conc@@ ept – “@@ l@@ a d@@ é@@ cl@@ in@@ ologi@@ e” – to descri@@ be this loss of self@@ –@@ confi@@ dence.
Moreover, the No vote has given a new legitimacy to euro@@ -@@ skep@@ tic@@ ism in other member states.
To be sure, the rise of populi@@ sm in Europe was not caused by the Fren@@ ch@@ ; nation@@ alism is deeply roo@@ ted in Europe’s history and has many caus@@ es.
But Franc@@ e’s refer@@ endum result fuel@@ ed other European government@@ s’ fear@@ s that any new proposal they might put forward to re-@@ laun@@ ch the EU constitu@@ tion would fail in the face of domestic and Europe@@ -@@ wide opposi@@ tion.
But reducing European as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions to the go@@ als of Re@@ al@@ politik is no answer to today’s crisis.
Europeans need to recognize that streng@@ th lies in un@@ ity, and that Europe’s integration cannot be guarante@@ ed without a common constitutional framework that promo@@ tes a common identi@@ ty.
Un@@ til we think in terms of European sovereign@@ ty, rather than fre@@ t over risks to national sovereign@@ ty, the present crisis cannot be over@@ come.
K@@ ER@@ A@@ L@@ A@@ , IN@@ D@@ I@@ A – Beg@@ inn@@ ing this mon@@ th, the largest exerc@@ ise of the democratic fran@@ ch@@ ise in history will take plac@@ e, as India n voters head to the poll@@ s to elec@@ t a new national parliament@@ . They have done this 1@@ 4 times since India gain@@ ed its indepen@@ dence.
E@@ ach time India has voted has been the world’s largest exerc@@ ise in electoral democracy. India’s growing population ke@@ ep@@ s break@@ ing its own rec@@ or@@ d.
This time, the elector@@ ate includes 7@@ 1@@ 4 million vo@@ ters, an increase of 4@@ 3 million over the previous general election in 200@@ 4.
V@@ o@@ tes will be c@@ ast in 8@@ 2@@ 8@@ ,@@ 8@@ 0@@ 4 poll@@ ing st@@ ations sc@@ at@@ tered throughout the country for over 5@@ 000 candidates from se@@ ven national political parties and several state and other parti@@ es.
The process invol@@ ves four million electoral officials and 6@@ .@@ 1 million police and civilian person@@ n@@ el@@ .
The numbers involved are so huge that the elections will be stag@@ ger@@ ed over five ph@@ as@@ es, ending only on Ma@@ y 1@@ 3, with electoral and security person@@ ne@@ l being mo@@ ved from state to state as poll@@ ing is conclu@@ ded in each plac@@ e.
Despite the ph@@ as@@ ed vo@@ t@@ ing, the coun@@ ting takes place nation@@ wide immedi@@ ately after the last ph@@ as@@ e, and the results of the elections every@@ where will be announced on Ma@@ y 1@@ 6.
A new parli@@ ament will be conven@@ ed on Jun@@ e 2 to elec@@ t a national government to succe@@ ed the out@@ going administration of Prime Minister Man@@ mo@@ h@@ an Sing@@ h@@ .
India’s elec@@ tions, conduc@@ ted by the autonom@@ ous (and all-@@ power@@ ful@@ ) E@@ lec@@ tion Commission of India , are an extra@@ ordinary ev@@ ent, and not just because of their she@@ er sc@@ al@@ e.
It takes the f@@ elling of a si@@ ze@@ able for@@ est to fur@@ nis@@ h enough pap@@ er for 7@@ 1@@ 4 million bal@@ lo@@ ts, and every election has at least one story of offic@@ ers batt@@ ling through s@@ now or j@@ ung@@ le, or tra@@ vel@@ ing by el@@ ep@@ h@@ ant and c@@ am@@ el, to ensure that the democratic wi@@ sh@@ es of remo@@ te constitu@@ ents are du@@ ly rec@@ or@@ ded.

Nor is any Indian election complete without the media publi@@ sh@@ ing at least one p@@ ic@@ ture of a f@@ em@@ ale vo@@ ter whose enth@@ usi@@ as@@ m for the suff@@ ra@@ ge is un@@ di@@ mm@@ ed by the fact that she is ol@@ d, blin@@ d, cri@@ pp@@ le@@ d, to@@ o@@ th@@ l@@ ess, pur@@ dah@@ -@@ cl@@ ad, or any combin@@ ation of the abo@@ ve.
The ex@@ o@@ tic@@ a do not end ther@@ e.
Because so many voters are illi@@ ter@@ ate, India inv@@ ented the party sym@@ bol@@ , so that voters who cannot re@@ ad the name of their candidate can vote for him or her any@@ way by recogni@@ zing the symbo@@ l under which they campaig@@ n@@ ed.
Sy@@ m@@ bol@@ s range from the open pal@@ m of the ruling Indian National Congress to the lo@@ tu@@ s of the B@@ har@@ ati@@ y@@ a J@@ an@@ at@@ a Party and vari@@ ants of the ham@@ mer and si@@ ck@@ le for India’s pro@@ fu@@ sion of Communist parti@@ es.
In@@ dependent candidates can choose from an ass@@ or@@ t@@ ment of altern@@ ativ@@ es, ran@@ ging from a cri@@ ck@@ et b@@ at to ima@@ ges of various large anim@@ als.
(@@ S@@ m@@ all ones were remo@@ ved from the list when one candid@@ ate, running against another whose symbo@@ l was a par@@ ro@@ t, w@@ r@@ ung the nec@@ k of a live par@@ ro@@ t at a public meeting to signi@@ fy what he would do to his ri@@ val@@ .)
India was also the first country to use an in@@ deli@@ ble sta@@ in on the vo@@ ter@@ ’s f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail to signi@@ fy that he has already c@@ ast his bal@@ lo@@ t.
At every elec@@ tion, some@@ one “@@ dis@@ co@@ vers@@ ” a new chem@@ ical that will re@@ move the sta@@ in and per@@ mit one to vote t@@ wi@@ ce, though this is unlikely to make a great difference in constitu@@ en@@ cies the size of Indi@@ a@@ ’@@ s, where each M@@ P repres@@ ents more than two million people.
Likewise, some dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ished vo@@ ter inv@@ ari@@ ably claims that his name is mis@@ sing from the ro@@ ll@@ s, or that some@@ one has already c@@ ast his vote (@@ but usually not bo@@ th@@ ).
In any case, India’s elections have a re@@ put@@ ation for hon@@ est@@ y.
In this elec@@ tion, as in previous on@@ es, vo@@ tes will be c@@ ast on elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic vo@@ ting mach@@ ines inv@@ ented in India, which comb@@ ine the vir@@ tu@@ es of simp@@ lic@@ ity, reli@@ abilit@@ y, and ru@@ g@@ ge@@ d@@ n@@ ess.
The electoral ro@@ ll@@ s carry p@@ ho@@ to@@ graph@@ s of every individual vo@@ ter, as does each vo@@ ter@@ ’s identi@@ ty car@@ d.
The elections have also been increasingly free of viol@@ ence.
There was a time wh@@ en, in certain parts of India, workers could st@@ uf@@ f bal@@ lot bo@@ x@@ es for a candidate and political parties could “@@ cap@@ tu@@ re@@ ” poll@@ ing boo@@ th@@ s.
E@@ lec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic vo@@ ting mach@@ ines and stri@@ c@@ t security arran@@ gements have largely elimin@@ ated that possi@@ bilit@@ y.
It has been some time since there were repor@@ ts of the occ@@ a@@ sion@@ al election work@@ er, candid@@ ate, or vo@@ ter being ass@@ aul@@ ted, k@@ id@@ n@@ app@@ ed, or sho@@ t.
No@@ thing (@@ short of the death of a major con@@ ten@@ der@@ ) inter@@ rup@@ ts the fran@@ ch@@ is@@ e.
E@@ lec@@ tions are an en@@ during spec@@ tac@@ le of free India, and give foreign journ@@ alists the opportunity to remin@@ d the world that India is the world’s largest democracy.
Indeed, Indi@@ ans now take for gran@@ ted that elections will take plac@@ e, that they will be free and fair@@ , and that they will result in ac@@ tual trans@@ f@@ ers of power.
There are few developing countries in the world where this is tru@@ e, and fe@@ wer still where poverty and illi@@ ter@@ acy are both ri@@ f@@ e.
That may be the real mi@@ rac@@ le of what will occ@@ ur in India over the next few week@@ s.
While the inter@@ net boom la@@ st@@ ed, nothing seemed able to defl@@ ate the bub@@ ble.
F@@ e@@ w inter@@ net and do@@ t co@@ m companies were profit@@ able, but investors never seemed to min@@ d.
They look@@ ed at the number of custom@@ ers or sub@@ s@@ cri@@ bers as the basis for valu@@ ing inter@@ net stock@@ s.
The name of the g@@ ame became raising capit@@ al, not making prof@@ its.
Even when fas@@ hi@@ on@@ able stock@@ s di@@ pp@@ ed, there was remark@@ ably little effect on the rest of the market.
People had learned that it pa@@ ys to buy the di@@ p@@ s, and were not we@@ an@@ ed from the hab@@ it until it c@@ eas@@ ed to pa@@ y.
Now that inter@@ net f@@ ever has ab@@ ated, we he@@ ar that the “@@ fundament@@ al@@ s” are reas@@ ser@@ ting themsel@@ ves.
But this view is as much a hal@@ f-@@ truth as the previous no@@ tion that the boom would last for@@ ever because the inter@@ net economy had created new fundament@@ als.
Indeed, the inter@@ net boom@@ /@@ b@@ ust cy@@ cle br@@ ings into question prev@@ ail@@ ing economic the@@ ories about financial markets.
What should now be clear is that the so-called fundament@@ als that sup@@ pos@@ edly determin@@ e stock prices are not in@@ depend@@ ently gi@@ v@@ en.
Instead, they are con@@ t@@ ing@@ ent on the behavior of financial markets.
There are, indeed, my@@ ri@@ ad ways in which stock prices aff@@ ect the fortun@@ es of compani@@ es: they determin@@ e the cost of equity capit@@ al@@ ; they decide whether a company will be taken over or acqu@@ ire other compani@@ es; stock prices influence a comp@@ an@@ y’s capacity to bor@@ row and its ability to attrac@@ t and re@@ ward management through stock op@@ tions@@ ; stock prices serve as an ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing and market@@ ing tool@@ .
In other words, when financial markets believe a company is doing well@@ , its “@@ fundament@@ al@@ s” impro@@ ve@@ ; when markets change their min@@ d, the ac@@ tual fortun@@ es of the company change with them.
Moreover, changes in financial markets also have far reach@@ ing macroeconomic consequ@@ enc@@ es.
It did not take a gen@@ i@@ us to re@@ alize that the inter@@ net boom@@ , based not on prof@@ it expect@@ ations but on the expect@@ ations of s@@ elling stock to the public at ever increasing prices, res@@ ted on an un@@ sustainable business model@@ .
It also did not take a gen@@ i@@ us to see that boom would be followed by bu@@ st, but it was har@@ der to gu@@ ess when that b@@ ust would occur@@ .
In the sum@@ mer of 1999 I was convinc@@ ed that an inter@@ net cra@@ sh was im@@ min@@ ent.
Yet inter@@ net stock@@ s recover@@ ed from a short di@@ p@@ ; some soon ro@@ se to new high@@ s.
Institu@@ tions that live and die by relative performance fel@@ t oblig@@ ed to increase their inter@@ net hol@@ d@@ ings.
When Y@@ ah@@ o@@ o was inclu@@ ded in the S@@ &@@ P 500 In@@ de@@ x@@ , it j@@ ump@@ ed 3@@ 0% in a da@@ y.
People like me who had sol@@ d inter@@ net stock@@ s short in the belief that a cra@@ sh was im@@ min@@ ent were forced to cover them at wh@@ opp@@ ing los@@ ses.
I remained convinc@@ ed that a b@@ ust was bound to come, but I could not afford to stand by my con@@ vic@@ tions.
Despite its ir@@ rational asp@@ ec@@ ts, the inter@@ net boom was more than a matter of infl@@ ated valu@@ ations.
The optim@@ ism of the financial markets not only changed the “@@ fundament@@ al@@ s” of individual business@@ es, it had real and pro@@ found effects throughout the whole economy.
The boom did not only follow from the development of the intern@@ et@@ ; it acceler@@ ated that development and contribut@@ ed to the spe@@ ed and exten@@ sion of technological innov@@ ation.
The same was true in tel@@ ec@@ om@@ mun@@ ic@@ ations, where the boom also acceler@@ ated the spread of new technolog@@ y.
The inter@@ net bu@@ st, when it finally c@@ am@@ e, was caused not by an un@@ sound business model@@ , but by over-@@ exten@@ sion of credi@@ t.
The present slow@@ down is affec@@ ting the fundament@@ als of individual companies almost as much as their stock pric@@ es; it also affec@@ ts the financial system and macroeconomic performan@@ ce.
Inste@@ ad of a one-@@ way connec@@ tion in which financial markets dis@@ coun@@ t the future more or less ac@@ cur@@ ately, there ex@@ ists a two-@@ way connec@@ tion in which financial markets shap@@ e the future they are supposed to dis@@ coun@@ t.
Inste@@ ad of a single out@@ come, there is a range of possi@@ bili@@ ties.
Wh@@ ich of those possi@@ bili@@ ties materi@@ aliz@@ es depends not only on the future ev@@ olution of the so-called fundament@@ als but on financial market behavior as well.
In these circum@@ st@@ ances, it is ir@@ rational for market particip@@ ants to b@@ ase their decisions sol@@ ely on their expect@@ ations about fundament@@ als because the fundament@@ als do not determin@@ e market pric@@ es; on the contrary, they are shap@@ ed by market condi@@ tions.
So what matters to market particip@@ ants is the future course of market prices, not the fundament@@ als they are said to reflec@@ t.
If market prices de@@ vi@@ ate from a the@@ ore@@ tical equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um there can be no ass@@ ur@@ ance that they will ever return to it.
This is why the recent boom@@ /@@ b@@ ust sequ@@ ence in inter@@ net and tel@@ ec@@ om@@ mun@@ ic@@ ation stock@@ s is so reve@@ al@@ ing.
These develop@@ ments cannot be expla@@ ined in terms of efficient markets and rational expect@@ ations.
I have proposed an alternative explan@@ ation based on the two-@@ way connec@@ tion between fundament@@ als and valu@@ ations which I call “@@ ref@@ lexi@@ vit@@ y@@ ”@@ .
I am am@@ az@@ ed and am@@ used that economists ignor@@ e my argum@@ ents.
They claim that the ph@@ en@@ omen@@ on of ref@@ lexi@@ v@@ ity is already taken into account in the conc@@ ept of multi@@ ple equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ a which has gain@@ ed accep@@ t@@ ance rec@@ ent@@ ly.
Ma@@ y@@ be so, but I have yet to see how persi@@ st@@ ent movem@@ ents away from a the@@ ore@@ tical equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um can be expla@@ ined within the framework of multi@@ ple equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ a.
An@@ y diver@@ gence from equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um, whether one assum@@ es that there is a uni@@ que equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um or many equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ a, amoun@@ ts to more than no@@ is@@ e; it is a caus@@ al factor in determin@@ ing the very nature of the “@@ equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um@@ ” that will prev@@ ail@@ .
By ignor@@ ing this condi@@ tion, efficient market theory pres@@ ents a tot@@ ally mis@@ leading p@@ ic@@ ture of financial markets.
Why is my reason@@ ing dis@@ mis@@ sed out of hand@@ ?
Because it lead@@ s to the conclu@@ sion that financial markets are inher@@ ently un@@ predict@@ able.
What is the value of a scientific the@@ or@@ y, I am as@@ k@@ ed, if it does not yiel@@ d us@@ e@@ able predic@@ tions@@ ?
I con@@ tend that it would be better to recognize the uncertain@@ ties inher@@ ent in the behavior of financial markets than to cl@@ ing to a sup@@ pos@@ edly scientific theory that di@@ stor@@ ts re@@ ality.
One consequ@@ ence of the re@@ alization that financial markets are potentially un@@ stab@@ le, is a recogni@@ tion of the need for financial authorities to make it their business to prevent exc@@ ess@@ es.
The debate about efficient markets may be ar@@ can@@ e, but the consequences for our lives are very real inde@@ ed.
BR@@ I@@ S@@ B@@ AN@@ E – What will happen if C@@ aliforni@@ ans vo@@ tes this November to leg@@ alize m@@ ari@@ ju@@ an@@ a use by any ad@@ ul@@ t over the age of 2@@ 1 year@@ s?
L@@ et@@ ’s ignor@@ e for the moment the v@@ ex@@ ed constitutional issues that will be raised if a US state en@@ ac@@ ts legisl@@ ation that conflic@@ ts with federal law@@ .
L@@ et@@ ’s focus instead on what may happen if the law changes as the refer@@ endum propos@@ es.
If we are to believe the refer@@ end@@ um@@ ’s suppor@@ ters, all C@@ aliforni@@ ans will be winn@@ ers.
The change will legitim@@ i@@ ze m@@ ari@@ ju@@ an@@ a’s de fac@@ to legal status since pas@@ sage of Pro@@ position 2@@ 15 in 199@@ 6.
It will thus reduce state expendi@@ ture on en@@ forc@@ ing a widely viol@@ ated law@@ ; re@@ move m@@ ari@@ ju@@ an@@ a growing and s@@ elling from the bl@@ ack market@@ ; enable any ad@@ ul@@ t who wi@@ sh@@ es to use m@@ ari@@ ju@@ an@@ a to do so@@ ; and intro@@ duce a tax on legal m@@ ari@@ ju@@ an@@ a s@@ ales that will f@@ ill state co@@ ff@@ ers with reven@@ ue that form@@ er@@ ly went to il@@ legal gro@@ wer@@ s (@@ so long as there is no lar@@ ge-@@ scale tax ev@@ a@@ sion@@ ).
By contrast, oppon@@ ents predic@@ t that the change will increase rates of m@@ ari@@ ju@@ an@@ a us@@ e, and thus ma@@ gni@@ fy the har@@ m ar@@ is@@ ing from that us@@ e.
The ad@@ verse consequences of greatest concern include more m@@ ari@@ ju@@ an@@ a-@@ related road tra@@ ff@@ ic ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents and death@@ s; more p@@ sy@@ cho@@ ses and other serious mental health problems among heav@@ y us@@ er@@ s; and he@@ a@@ vier m@@ ari@@ ju@@ an@@ a use by young people, neg@@ ati@@ vely affec@@ ting their life chan@@ c@@ es.
These effec@@ ts, they argu@@ e, will more than off@@ set any gains from tax reven@@ ue and savings from law en@@ forc@@ em@@ ent.
It is difficult to know who is righ@@ t, because no other country has adopted this policy.
The Ne@@ ther@@ land@@ s, which is popul@@ arly believed to have leg@@ alized can@@ n@@ ab@@ is use along these lin@@ es, has in fact toler@@ ated only sm@@ all-@@ scale re@@ ta@@ il s@@ ales of m@@ ari@@ ju@@ an@@ a in a limited number of co@@ ff@@ e@@ e sh@@ ops in its larger ci@@ ties.
M@@ ari@@ ju@@ an@@ a cul@@ tiv@@ ation remains il@@ legal and co@@ ff@@ e@@ e sh@@ op s@@ ales are regul@@ ated – more stri@@ c@@ tly in recent years in response to comp@@ la@@ in@@ ts from neighbor@@ ing countries about “@@ drug tou@@ ris@@ m@@ .”
Nevertheless, some broad predic@@ tions can be ma@@ de.
First, open@@ ly toler@@ ating a market in a pre@@ viously il@@ legal commodi@@ ty will exp@@ and the number of us@@ ers, especially if the re@@ ta@@ il price is lower than the bl@@ ack@@ -@@ market price (@@ as is proposed in the Am@@ mi@@ an@@ o Bill currently before the C@@ aliforni@@ a legis@@ lat@@ u@@ re@@ ).
U@@ se may not increase immedi@@ ately, but it will over time, because m@@ ari@@ ju@@ an@@ a will become more fre@@ ely avail@@ able, much che@@ ap@@ er (@@ in order to disc@@ oura@@ ge the persi@@ st@@ ence of a bl@@ ack market@@ ), and its use will be implic@@ it@@ ly con@@ don@@ ed.
Ex@@ peri@@ ence with al@@ co@@ ho@@ l suggests that m@@ ari@@ ju@@ an@@ a will be available to under@@ age us@@ ers (@@ as it is now@@ ), whatever the minim@@ um legal age.
Thus, leg@@ ally available che@@ ap@@ er m@@ ari@@ ju@@ an@@ a will probably mean more use by more young people, and probably more da@@ ily use later into ad@@ ul@@ tho@@ od. In gener@@ al, the more people who use a dru@@ g, the larger the number of problem us@@ ers there will be (@@ on the reason@@ able assu@@ mp@@ tion that problem us@@ ers com@@ pri@@ se a fix@@ ed propor@@ tion of all us@@ er@@ s@@ ).
If current estim@@ ates are correc@@ t, around 10% of us@@ ers (and one in six who start in ad@@ ol@@ es@@ c@@ enc@@ e) may become dependent on m@@ ari@@ ju@@ an@@ a – that is, find it difficult to control or dis@@ continue their us@@ e.
A min@@ ority of these problem us@@ ers will seek profession@@ al help to qu@@ it.
Dep@@ end@@ ent m@@ ari@@ ju@@ an@@ a us@@ ers are more likely to experience road and work@@ place ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents (@@ if they drive or work while in@@ tox@@ ic@@ at@@ ed@@ )@@ ; increased resp@@ ir@@ atory disease (@@ if they smo@@ ke m@@ ari@@ ju@@ an@@ a@@ )@@ ; exac@@ erb@@ ations of some serious mental dis@@ order@@ s; and im@@ pa@@ i@@ red school and work performan@@ ce.
It is un@@ certain how far these ad@@ verse effects can be mi@@ tig@@ ated by pre@@ ven@@ tive measures such as implement@@ ing road@@ side dru@@ g-@@ test@@ ing program@@ s, persu@@ ad@@ ing us@@ ers to use v@@ ap@@ ori@@ z@@ ers rather than smo@@ ke jo@@ in@@ ts, disc@@ oura@@ ging young people from using m@@ ari@@ ju@@ an@@ a, and encoura@@ ging early treatment for problem us@@ ers.
Ex@@ peri@@ ence with al@@ co@@ ho@@ l suggests that these approach@@ es may mo@@ dest@@ ly reduc@@ e, but not elimin@@ ate, the har@@ ms associated with us@@ e, especially if s@@ ell@@ ers are allowed to promote their war@@ es.
Indeed, the scale of any increase in m@@ ari@@ ju@@ an@@ a use will critic@@ ally depend on how ti@@ gh@@ tly regul@@ ated m@@ ari@@ ju@@ an@@ a s@@ ales are – how many lic@@ ens@@ ed gro@@ wer@@ s there are, the number of s@@ ales out@@ le@@ ts, their loc@@ ations and trading ho@@ ur@@ s, eli@@ gi@@ bility require@@ ments for us@@ e, con@@ tent of T@@ H@@ C (@@ m@@ ari@@ ju@@ an@@ a’s p@@ sy@@ cho@@ active ing@@ redi@@ ent@@ ), and how much promo@@ tion and ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing is allow@@ ed.
If m@@ ari@@ ju@@ an@@ a were allowed to be market@@ ed much like al@@ co@@ ho@@ l is now, we could expect more problem us@@ ers than if it were regul@@ ated more like p@@ har@@ mac@@ eu@@ tical dru@@ gs (@@ say, by requ@@ iring us@@ ers to be lic@@ ens@@ ed@@ ; restric@@ ting the number of s@@ ales loc@@ ations, ho@@ urs of sal@@ e, and lic@@ ens@@ ed gro@@ wer@@ s; and im@@ posing high rates of tax@@ ation on hig@@ her@@ -@@ T@@ H@@ C m@@ ari@@ ju@@ an@@ a@@ ).
It will be a major policy challenge to get this balance righ@@ t.
Gre@@ ater restric@@ tions would provide incentives for il@@ legal oper@@ ators to rema@@ in, while less restric@@ tive regulation would disc@@ oura@@ ge bl@@ ack mark@@ e@@ te@@ ers, but at the price of increasing the number of us@@ ers and problem us@@ er@@ s@@ .@@ &#160;
M@@ ari@@ ju@@ an@@ a policy invol@@ ves a choice between the ev@@ il@@ s of current repres@@ sive policies and the ev@@ il@@ s of increased use under a legal market.
C@@ aliforni@@ ans will have to decide how much wei@@ ght to give to respect for ad@@ ul@@ t liber@@ ty, protection of min@@ ors, avo@@ id@@ ance of a lar@@ ge-@@ scale bl@@ ack market, fiscal consider@@ ations, and protection of m@@ ari@@ ju@@ an@@ a us@@ er@@ s’ heal@@ th.
If they vote for leg@@ aliz@@ ation, it will probably be 20 years or more before anyone can say wh@@ eth@@ er, on bal@@ ance, they decided wi@@ sel@@ y.
PR@@ IN@@ CE@@ T@@ ON – When the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ i hit Japan in Mar@@ ch, Bri@@ an Tu@@ ck@@ er was in P@@ ad@@ ang@@ , Indonesi@@ a.
Tu@@ ck@@ er was working with a colle@@ ague to desig@@ n a refu@@ ge that could save thousands of lives if – or ra@@ ther, when – a ts@@ un@@ am@@ i like the one in 17@@ 9@@ 7 that came out of the Indian Oc@@ e@@ an, some 6@@ 00 mil@@ es sou@@ the@@ ast of where the 2004 Asian ts@@ un@@ am@@ i origin@@ ated, strik@@ es again@@ .
Tu@@ ck@@ er is the fo@@ under and president of Ge@@ o@@ H@@ az@@ ards Internation@@ al, a non@@ prof@@ it organiz@@ ation whose mission is to reduce death and suff@@ ering due to ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ak@@ es in the world’s most vulnerable communi@@ ties.
P@@ ad@@ ang is one of those communi@@ ties.
J@@ ust to its nor@@ th@@ wes@@ t, in B@@ anda Ac@@ eh@@ , 160@@ ,000 lives were lost in the 2004 ts@@ un@@ am@@ i@@ .
N@@ ow, ge@@ ologi@@ sts say, the f@@ aul@@ t that trig@@ ger@@ ed that ts@@ un@@ am@@ i is most likely to rup@@ ture far@@ ther sou@@ th, put@@ ting low-@@ lying co@@ ast@@ al to@@ w@@ ns like P@@ ad@@ ang@@ , with a population of 9@@ 00@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0, at high risk of a major ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ i within the next 30 years.
In B@@ anda Ac@@ eh@@ , the ts@@ un@@ am@@ i killed more than half the c@@ it@@ y’s popul@@ ation.
In P@@ ad@@ ang@@ , according to an estim@@ ate by the direc@@ tor of the c@@ it@@ y’s disa@@ ster management offic@@ e, a similar ts@@ un@@ am@@ i could k@@ ill more than 4@@ 00@@ ,000 people.
Tu@@ ck@@ er sa@@ ys that he has stood on the be@@ ach in P@@ ad@@ ang@@ , looking out at the oc@@ e@@ an and trying to imag@@ ine what it would be like to see a fi@@ ve-@@ me@@ ter@@ -@@ high w@@ all of water stre@@ t@@ ching across the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on, be@@ aring down on the c@@ ity.
Now that we have seen the fo@@ o@@ tage of the ts@@ un@@ am@@ i that hit Japan, the demands on our imag@@ in@@ ation have been l@@ essen@@ ed – exc@@ ept that we have to imag@@ ine away the se@@ a w@@ all@@ s that Japan had built to reduce the impact of the ts@@ un@@ am@@ i@@ .
Tru@@ e, those w@@ all@@ s did not work as well as had been hop@@ ed, but Japan was non@@ eth@@ eless much better prepared for a ts@@ un@@ am@@ i than P@@ ad@@ ang is.
In P@@ ad@@ ang@@ , even with adv@@ ance war@@ ning of a ts@@ un@@ am@@ i, higher ground is too far a@@ way, and the nar@@ row stre@@ ets too ch@@ ok@@ ed with tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ , for many people to get to safety in time.
Ge@@ o@@ H@@ az@@ ards International is therefore working on a more prac@@ tical ide@@ a, which it calls a T@@ sun@@ am@@ i E@@ v@@ ac@@ u@@ ation Ra@@ is@@ ed E@@ ar@@ th Par@@ k (@@ T@@ ER@@ E@@ P@@ ).
The idea is to build small h@@ ill@@ s in low-@@ lying parts of the c@@ ity, with level t@@ ops that could be used as par@@ ks or spor@@ ts fiel@@ ds.
With the few min@@ ut@@ es’ war@@ ning that an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ak@@ e’s strong sh@@ aking would automati@@ cally provi@@ de, people could wal@@ k to a T@@ ER@@ E@@ P and be safe above the highest level a ts@@ un@@ am@@ i could reach@@ .
Such raised ear@@ th par@@ ks are a low-@@ cost solution to the ts@@ un@@ am@@ i danger in low-@@ lying co@@ ast@@ al are@@ as.
They use only local materi@@ als, provide a valu@@ able community resour@@ ce in normal tim@@ es, and have the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives when a ts@@ un@@ am@@ i strik@@ es.
Nevertheless, Ge@@ o@@ H@@ az@@ ards International lack@@ s the resources to build anything like enough T@@ ER@@ E@@ P@@ s to meet the ne@@ ed.
After 20 years of oper@@ ation, the organiz@@ ation remains tin@@ y, especially when compared to organizations like the R@@ ed C@@ ros@@ s, which pri@@ mar@@ ily do disa@@ ster re@@ lief work.
People are willing to don@@ ate hundreds of millions of dollars to help people after a disa@@ ster – even after a disa@@ ster in a weal@@ thy country like Japan – but are un@@ willing to invest anything like the same amount to save lives before a predict@@ able disa@@ ster strik@@ es.
One reason for this is that prev@@ enting a disa@@ ster does not make good tel@@ evi@@ sion.
People give to identi@@ fi@@ able victim@@ s.
If we build raised ear@@ th par@@ k@@ s, we will never see the people wh@@ o, but for our ai@@ d, would have di@@ ed@@ ; no or@@ ph@@ ans in des@@ per@@ ate need will appear on the ni@@ gh@@ tly new@@ s.
But is@@ n’t it much better to keep par@@ ents safe than to help or@@ ph@@ ans after their par@@ ents have been k@@ il@@ led@@ ?
This is a situation in which we must stre@@ t@@ ch our imag@@ in@@ ation, to understand and be mo@@ tiv@@ ated by the good that we are do@@ ing.
Unfortunately, not everyone can do th@@ at.
Another reason why we do not give to prevent disa@@ st@@ ers should be famili@@ ar to anyone who has ever del@@ a@@ yed going to the denti@@ st because the prospect of serious pa@@ in in the coming week@@ s or months just w@@ as@@ n’t as mo@@ tiv@@ ating as the rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ance to face some more immediate s@@ light dis@@ com@@ for@@ t.
We tel@@ l our@@ sel@@ ves that ma@@ y@@ be we won@@ ’t get a to@@ o@@ th@@ ache after all, even though we know that the od@@ ds are that we will@@ .
Most of us are not very good at giving pro@@ per wei@@ ght to future event@@ s, especially if they are uncertain@@ .
So we may tel@@ l our@@ sel@@ ves that the ge@@ ologi@@ sts could be wron@@ g, and perhaps no ts@@ un@@ am@@ i will hit P@@ ad@@ ang in the next 30 years, and by then perhaps we will have new and better technologies for predic@@ ting them, giving people more time to get to higher ground@@ .
Instead, we should be gu@@ ided by the best estim@@ ates of the chan@@ ces that an intervention will save li@@ ves, as well as by the number of lives that would be sav@@ ed, and the cost of saving those li@@ ves.
The evidence suggests that building raised ear@@ th par@@ ks in places like P@@ ad@@ ang is very good value inde@@ ed.
ST@@ AN@@ F@@ OR@@ D – During the late 199@@ 0’s, a sing@@ ular ph@@ en@@ omen@@ on appe@@ ared in countries around the world.
One after ano@@ ther, food and be@@ ver@@ age companies capit@@ ul@@ ated to activi@@ sts op@@ posed to a promis@@ ing new technolog@@ y: the genetic engine@@ ering of plan@@ ts to produce ing@@ redi@@ ents.
They are still capit@@ ul@@ ating to this da@@ y.
The Japanese bre@@ wer Kir@@ in and the Dan@@ ish bre@@ wer Car@@ l@@ s@@ ber@@ g elimin@@ ated gene@@ tic@@ ally engine@@ ered ing@@ redi@@ ents from their be@@ ers.
In the United States, the fa@@ st-@@ food gi@@ ant Mc@@ D@@ on@@ al@@ d@@ 's b@@ ann@@ ed them from its men@@ u@@ ; food manufac@@ tur@@ ers H@@ ein@@ z and Ger@@ ber (@@ then a divi@@ sion of S@@ wi@@ tz@@ er@@ land@@ -@@ based No@@ v@@ arti@@ s) dro@@ pped them from their bab@@ y-@@ food lin@@ es; and Fri@@ to-@@ La@@ y de@@ man@@ ded that its gro@@ wer@@ s stop plan@@ ting cor@@ n engine@@ ered to con@@ tain a b@@ ac@@ teri@@ al pro@@ t@@ ein that conf@@ ers resist@@ ance to in@@ sec@@ t pre@@ d@@ ation.
These measures were ration@@ alized in various way@@ s, but the reality is that by yiel@@ ding to the demands of a min@@ us@@ cu@@ le number of di@@ sin@@ genu@@ ous activi@@ sts, the companies op@@ ted to offer less safe products to consu@@ mer@@ s, thereby ex@@ posing themselves to legal je@@ op@@ ard@@ y.
E@@ very year, inn@@ um@@ er@@ able pack@@ age@@ d-@@ food products worldwide are with@@ held or rec@@ all@@ ed from the market due to the presence of “@@ all natur@@ al@@ ” con@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ ants like in@@ sec@@ t par@@ ts, tox@@ ic m@@ old@@ s, b@@ ac@@ teri@@ a, and vi@@ rus@@ es.
Because farm@@ ing takes place out@@ do@@ ors and in di@@ r@@ t, such con@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ ation is a fact of life.
O@@ ver the cent@@ uri@@ es, the main cul@@ pri@@ t in mass food po@@ is@@ on@@ ing often has been con@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ ation of un@@ proc@@ essed c@@ ro@@ ps by f@@ ung@@ al tox@@ ins – a risk that is exac@@ erb@@ ated when in@@ sec@@ ts attack food c@@ ro@@ p@@ s, opening wo@@ und@@ s that allow f@@ ung@@ i (@@ m@@ old@@ s) to get a fo@@ o@@ th@@ ol@@ d.
For example, f@@ um@@ oni@@ sin and some other f@@ ung@@ al tox@@ ins are highly tox@@ ic@@ , caus@@ ing es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al canc@@ er in hum@@ ans and f@@ at@@ al diseas@@ es in li@@ v@@ est@@ o@@ ck that e@@ at infec@@ ted cor@@ n.
F@@ um@@ oni@@ sin also inter@@ fer@@ es with the c@@ ell@@ ular up@@ take of f@@ oli@@ c aci@@ d, a vit@@ am@@ in that redu@@ ces the risk of neu@@ ral tu@@ be def@@ ec@@ ts in developing f@@ et@@ us@@ es, and thus can cause f@@ oli@@ c ac@@ id de@@ fici@@ ency – and def@@ ec@@ ts such as sp@@ in@@ a bi@@ fi@@ da – even when one’s di@@ et con@@ tains what other@@ wise would be sufficient amoun@@ ts of the vit@@ am@@ in.
Many regulatory agen@@ cies have therefore established re@@ commen@@ ded ma@@ xim@@ um f@@ um@@ oni@@ sin levels per@@ mit@@ ted in food and fe@@ ed products made from cor@@ n.
The conventional way to meet those standards and prevent the consumption of f@@ ung@@ al tox@@ ins is simply to test un@@ proc@@ essed and proc@@ essed gra@@ ins and dis@@ car@@ d those found to be con@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ ated – an approach that is both wa@@ st@@ eful and fail@@ u@@ re-@@ p@@ ron@@ e.
But modern technology – speci@@ fic@@ ally, the genetic engine@@ ering of plan@@ ts using re@@ combin@@ ant D@@ N@@ A technology (@@ also known as food bio@@ technology or genetic modi@@ fic@@ ation@@ ) – offers a way to prevent the problem.
Con@@ tr@@ ary to the claims of fo@@ od@@ -@@ bio@@ te@@ ch critic@@ s, who insi@@ st that gene@@ tic@@ ally modi@@ fied c@@ ro@@ ps pose risks (@@ n@@ one of which has actually occur@@ re@@ d@@ ) of new all@@ er@@ gen@@ s or tox@@ ins in the food sup@@ pl@@ y, such products offer the food industry a pro@@ ven and prac@@ tical means of tac@@ kl@@ ing the f@@ ung@@ al con@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ ation at its sourc@@ e.
An exc@@ ell@@ ent example is cor@@ n that is cra@@ f@@ ted by sp@@ lic@@ ing into commercial v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties a gene (or gen@@ es@@ ) from a har@@ m@@ less b@@ ac@@ teri@@ um.
The b@@ ac@@ teri@@ al gen@@ es ex@@ press pro@@ t@@ ein@@ s that are tox@@ ic to cor@@ n@@ -@@ bor@@ ing in@@ sec@@ ts, but that are har@@ m@@ less to bir@@ ds, fis@@ h@@ , and m@@ am@@ mal@@ s, including human@@ s.
As the modi@@ fied cor@@ n f@@ ends off in@@ sec@@ t p@@ est@@ s, it also redu@@ ces the levels of the m@@ old F@@ us@@ ari@@ um, thereby reducing the levels of f@@ um@@ on@@ is@@ in.
Indeed, resear@@ ch@@ ers at I@@ ow@@ a State University and the US De@@ part@@ ment of A@@ gri@@ culture have found that the level of f@@ um@@ oni@@ sin in the modi@@ fied cor@@ n is reduced by as much as 8@@ 0% compared to conventional cor@@ n.
Similarly, an Itali@@ an study of we@@ an@@ ed p@@ ig@@ le@@ ts that were f@@ ed either conventional cor@@ n or the same vari@@ ety modi@@ fied to syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze a b@@ ac@@ teri@@ al pro@@ t@@ ein that conf@@ ers resist@@ ance to in@@ sec@@ t pre@@ d@@ ation found that the modi@@ fied vari@@ ety contain@@ ed lower levels of f@@ um@@ on@@ is@@ in.
More importantly, the p@@ ig@@ le@@ ts that consum@@ ed the modi@@ fied cor@@ n achieved a greater final wei@@ gh@@ t, a measure of overall heal@@ th, despite no difference in fe@@ ed in@@ take between the two group@@ s.
Given the health benefits – to say nothing of the often higher and more reli@@ able yiel@@ ds – governments should intro@@ duce incentives aimed at increasing use of such gene@@ tic@@ ally engine@@ ered gra@@ ins and other c@@ ro@@ p@@ s.
In addi@@ tion, one would expect public-@@ health advoc@@ ates to demand that such improved v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties be cul@@ tiv@@ ated and used for fo@@ od, not un@@ like require@@ ments that drin@@ king water be ch@@ l@@ or@@ in@@ ated and flu@@ or@@ id@@ ated.
And food produc@@ ers that are committed to off@@ ering the saf@@ est and best products to their custom@@ ers should be comp@@ eting to get gene@@ tic@@ ally engine@@ ered products into the market@@ plac@@ e.
Al@@ as, n@@ one of this has come to pas@@ s.
Ac@@ tivi@@ sts continue to moun@@ t vo@@ cal and ten@@ aci@@ ous opposition to gene@@ tic@@ ally engine@@ ered fo@@ od@@ s, despite almost 20 years of demonstrat@@ ed, significant benef@@ its, including reduced use of chem@@ ical p@@ esti@@ ci@@ des (and thus less chem@@ ical run@@ off into w@@ ater@@ way@@ s@@ ), greater use of farm@@ ing practi@@ ces that prevent so@@ il ero@@ sion, higher prof@@ its for far@@ mer@@ s, and less f@@ ung@@ al con@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ ation.
Res@@ pon@@ ding to the ble@@ ating of activi@@ sts, policymakers have sub@@ jec@@ ted the test@@ ing and commer@@ ci@@ alization of gene@@ tic@@ ally engine@@ ered c@@ ro@@ ps to uns@@ ci@@ enti@@ fic and dra@@ con@@ ian regul@@ ations, with di@@ re consequ@@ enc@@ es.
A ground@@ break@@ ing study of the political economy of agricultural bio@@ technology conclu@@ ded that over-@@ regulation causes “@@ del@@ a@@ ys in the global diff@@ u@@ sion of pro@@ ven technologi@@ es, resulting in a lower rate of growth in the global food supply and higher food pric@@ es@@ .”
C@@ ur@@ r@@ ent policies also create “@@ di@@ sin@@ c@@ en@@ tives for invest@@ ing in further research and development, resulting in a slow@@ down in innov@@ ation of sec@@ ond@@ -@@ generation technologies anti@@ cip@@ ated to intro@@ duce broad consumer and environmental benef@@ it@@ s.”
E@@ ver@@ y@@ one involved in food production and consumption has suff@@ er@@ ed@@ : consum@@ ers (@@ especially in developing countri@@ es@@ ) have been sub@@ jec@@ ted to avo@@ id@@ able health risk@@ s, and food produc@@ ers have placed themselves in legal je@@ op@@ ard@@ y for s@@ elling products known to have “@@ desig@@ n def@@ ec@@ ts@@ .”
Pub@@ li@@ c policy that discrimin@@ ates against and disc@@ oura@@ ges vital innov@@ ations in food production is not policy that has the public@@ ’s interest at hear@@ t.
Thir@@ ty years ago America's president declared ``@@ war on canc@@ er@@ '@@ '@@ .
This year, in the US al@@ one, 1,@@ 500 men, women and children lose their personal batt@@ le with canc@@ er every da@@ y.
When will the war end@@ ? 
I believe that for many canc@@ ers the war will end so@@ on.
Th@@ anks to knowledge from basic resear@@ ch, we have new tool@@ s with which to attack canc@@ er.
These new tool@@ s are providing more rapid diagno@@ sis and more effective treat@@ ments.
They are produc@@ ing new dru@@ gs that target m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ular changes uni@@ que to canc@@ er c@@ ell@@ s, making it possible to predic@@ t who may be at risk for developing canc@@ er because of genetic or environmental factor@@ s.
These adv@@ ances will save many li@@ ves. 
C@@ anc@@ er affec@@ ts many different organ@@ s and ti@@ s@@ su@@ es in the bo@@ d@@ y.
Although canc@@ ers diff@@ er great@@ ly in their appear@@ ance and behavi@@ or, they have a common cau@@ se@@ : damage to gen@@ es.
Gen@@ es are chem@@ ical co@@ ding un@@ its that speci@@ fy the structure and func@@ tion of our bo@@ dies@@ .
All the c@@ ells in our bo@@ dies have the same comple@@ ment of gen@@ es, half from each of our par@@ ents.
What makes one kind of c@@ ell different from another is the combin@@ ation of gen@@ es that are active in each c@@ ell@@ . 
Gen@@ es can be dam@@ aged by environmental factor@@ s, such as radi@@ ation or chem@@ ic@@ als.
They can also be dam@@ aged by the products of normal met@@ ab@@ oli@@ sm@@ .
Our bo@@ dies have el@@ abor@@ ate re@@ pa@@ ir systems that maintain the integri@@ ty of our gen@@ es, even in the presence of dam@@ aging ag@@ ents.
O@@ cc@@ a@@ sion@@ ally, however, damage is not re@@ pa@@ i@@ re@@ d.
If the damage occur@@ s in key gen@@ es that regul@@ ate c@@ ell growth, canc@@ er can develop@@ .
The re@@ pa@@ ir systems themselves help protect us from canc@@ er.
For example, one kind of col@@ on canc@@ er develop@@ s more frequ@@ ently in individuals who have a def@@ ect in a system that re@@ pa@@ ir@@ s dam@@ aged gen@@ es. 
C@@ ell growth is regul@@ ated by a balance between gen@@ es that stimul@@ ate growth, and those that in@@ hi@@ b@@ it it.
Gen@@ es that stimul@@ ate c@@ ell growth are called 
 on@@ co@@ gen@@ es
 ; those that in@@ hi@@ b@@ it it are called 
 t@@ um@@ or sup@@ press@@ or gen@@ es
 .
When on@@ co@@ gen@@ es are activ@@ ated, or t@@ um@@ or sup@@ press@@ or gen@@ es dis@@ able@@ d, c@@ ells can multi@@ p@@ ly out of contro@@ l. 
On@@ co@@ gen@@ es can be activ@@ ated by mut@@ ation (@@ changes in gene structu@@ re@@ ) or by gene amp@@ li@@ fication (@@ production of many co@@ pi@@ es of a gene@@ ).
T@@ um@@ or sup@@ press@@ or gen@@ es can be dis@@ ab@@ led by mut@@ ation, or by sp@@ on@@ tane@@ ous loss during c@@ ell divi@@ sion.
C@@ anc@@ er c@@ ells are gene@@ tic@@ ally un@@ stab@@ le, that is, they have ab@@ normal numbers of ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es, the c@@ ell@@ ular el@@ ements that carry gen@@ es.
Gen@@ e@@ tic inst@@ ability contribut@@ es to loss of growth control by produc@@ ing im@@ balances in gene activ@@ ity. 
Tradi@@ tion@@ ally canc@@ er has been diagno@@ sed by the character@@ is@@ tic appear@@ ance of canc@@ er c@@ ells obser@@ ved through a m@@ ic@@ ros@@ co@@ p@@ e.
In@@ creas@@ ing@@ ly, canc@@ ers are identi@@ fied by their character@@ is@@ tic pat@@ tern@@ s of gene ac@@ tivity (@@ their ``@@ m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ular sig@@ natu@@ re@@ '@@ '@@ ).
New techni@@ qu@@ es, including ``@@ gene chi@@ p@@ s@@ '@@ '@@ , have made it possible to measure the ac@@ tivity of thousands of gen@@ es si@@ mul@@ tane@@ ous@@ ly.
The m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ular sig@@ nat@@ ures can be used to classi@@ fy canc@@ ers more precis@@ el@@ y, making them easier to treat@@ .
For example, these techni@@ qu@@ es have been used to identi@@ fy some kin@@ ds of lymp@@ hom@@ as (@@ canc@@ ers of the blo@@ od@@ ) that respond well to chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y.
Simil@@ ar techni@@ qu@@ es have been used to identi@@ fy gen@@ es involved in t@@ um@@ or met@@ ast@@ asi@@ s. 
Some genetic changes are common to many typ@@ es of canc@@ er, whereas other changes are specific to particular canc@@ ers.
D@@ oz@@ ens of on@@ co@@ gen@@ es and t@@ um@@ or sup@@ press@@ or gen@@ es have been identi@@ fi@@ ed, providing targe@@ ts for the development of new anti-@@ canc@@ er dru@@ g@@ s.
A stri@@ king recent example is a drug that targe@@ ts a m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ular change character@@ is@@ tic of chron@@ ic my@@ el@@ o@@ gen@@ ous le@@ u@@ k@@ em@@ ia c@@ ell@@ s.
The drug is providing an alternative to b@@ one mar@@ row tran@@ sp@@ lan@@ t@@ ation, the only treatment that was effective pre@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly. 
Mut@@ ations in certain gen@@ es have been found to cause her@@ edi@@ t@@ ary forms of bre@@ ast and o@@ vari@@ an canc@@ er.
This has made it possible to identi@@ fy women who may be at high risk because they inher@@ it these sus@@ c@@ ep@@ ti@@ bility gen@@ es.
(@@ In@@ her@@ ited forms of bre@@ ast and o@@ vari@@ an canc@@ er are only a small fra@@ c@@ tion of the to@@ tal@@ .)
C@@ lose ob@@ serv@@ ation and rapid treat@@ ment, or pro@@ ph@@ y@@ l@@ ac@@ tic sur@@ ger@@ y, can reduce the risk of these inher@@ ited forms of canc@@ er. 
Ad@@ v@@ ances in ima@@ ging techni@@ qu@@ es are making it possible to de@@ tec@@ t canc@@ er ear@@ li@@ er, which can help elimin@@ ate t@@ um@@ ors before they become life@@ -@@ threat@@ en@@ ing.
New ima@@ ging techni@@ qu@@ es are also helping to gu@@ ide sur@@ ger@@ y, so that t@@ um@@ ors can be remo@@ ved more precis@@ el@@ y. 
Other lead@@ s are emerging from a better understanding of how t@@ um@@ ors grow@@ .
T@@ um@@ ors need a pl@@ enti@@ ful blo@@ od sup@@ pl@@ y, so they produce factors that in@@ duce the form@@ ation of blo@@ od v@@ es@@ sel@@ s (@@ a process called an@@ gi@@ o@@ gen@@ es@@ is@@ ).
New dru@@ g@@ s, which have been designed to in@@ hi@@ b@@ it t@@ um@@ or an@@ gi@@ o@@ gen@@ es@@ is, are show@@ ing promise in cl@@ ini@@ cal tri@@ als. 
It is estimated that 10@@ -@@ 1@@ 5% of canc@@ er worldwide is associated with vi@@ ral infec@@ tion.
Li@@ ver canc@@ er, which is associated with h@@ ep@@ ati@@ ti@@ s, and cer@@ vi@@ cal canc@@ er, associated with human pap@@ ill@@ om@@ a vi@@ ru@@ s infec@@ tion, are promin@@ ent exam@@ pl@@ es.
A v@@ acc@@ ine against h@@ ep@@ ati@@ ti@@ s B vi@@ ru@@ s is pro@@ ving to be effective in reducing the inci@@ dence of li@@ ver canc@@ er.
R@@ ap@@ id and specific diagno@@ stic tests for the human pap@@ ill@@ om@@ a vi@@ ru@@ s are supp@@ lement@@ ing traditional P@@ ap test@@ s, helping to identi@@ fy women at risk for cer@@ vi@@ cal canc@@ er. 
One of the most in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing dis@@ cover@@ ies of modern bi@@ ology is that c@@ ell death is in@@ tim@@ ately involved with growth and development.
For example, ner@@ ve c@@ ells are produced in exc@@ ess, and some die in order for pro@@ per connec@@ tions to be established in the ner@@ v@@ ous system.
C@@ ells con@@ tain a ``@@ su@@ ici@@ de program@@ '' that is activ@@ ated when the c@@ ells are dam@@ aged beyond re@@ pa@@ ir@@ .
In@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing@@ ly, canc@@ er c@@ ells respond ab@@ norm@@ ally to death sign@@ als.
Some of the gen@@ es involved in the su@@ ici@@ de program are the same gen@@ es that are al@@ tered in canc@@ er c@@ ell@@ s.
A promis@@ ing approach now being ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ed for tre@@ ating canc@@ er is to activ@@ ate the su@@ ici@@ de program of canc@@ er c@@ ells without dist@@ ur@@ bing normal c@@ ell@@ s. 
Although the future cannot be predic@@ ted with ass@@ ur@@ ance, it seems reason@@ able to expect that the burden of canc@@ er will be reduced substanti@@ ally in the next ten years by new treat@@ ments.
For some canc@@ ers, like li@@ ver canc@@ er and chron@@ ic my@@ el@@ o@@ gen@@ ous le@@ u@@ k@@ em@@ ia men@@ tion@@ ed, this is already happ@@ en@@ ing.
For other canc@@ ers, the means for pre@@ vention are at hand, but the app@@ lic@@ ation is proble@@ mati@@ c@@ al, as in the case of lung canc@@ er caused by ci@@ gar@@ et@@ te smo@@ k@@ ing.
It is unlikely that most canc@@ ers will dis@@ appear in the near futu@@ re@@ ; rather they will be diagno@@ sed more precisely and tre@@ ated more effec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y, thereby increasing the number of people who can be cu@@ re@@ d. 
M@@ UN@@ IC@@ H – W@@ ould the world be more peaceful if women were in char@@ ge@@ ?
A challeng@@ ing new book by the Harv@@ ard University psych@@ olog@@ ist S@@ te@@ ven P@@ in@@ ker sa@@ ys that the answer is “@@ y@@ es@@ .”
In The Bet@@ ter Angel@@ s of Our Nat@@ u@@ re, P@@ in@@ ker pres@@ ents data show@@ ing that human viol@@ ence, while still very much with us today, has been gradu@@ ally decl@@ in@@ ing.
Moreover, he sa@@ y@@ s, “@@ over the long s@@ we@@ ep of history, women have been and will be a p@@ aci@@ fying forc@@ e.
Tradi@@ tional war is a man@@ ’s gam@@ e: tri@@ b@@ al women never b@@ and together to ra@@ id neighbor@@ ing v@@ ill@@ ag@@ es@@ .”
As mo@@ ther@@ s, women have ev@@ olu@@ tionary incentives to maintain peaceful conditions in which to n@@ ur@@ ture their off@@ spr@@ ing and ensure that their gen@@ es survi@@ ve into the next gener@@ ation.
Sk@@ ep@@ tics immedi@@ ately rep@@ ly that women have not made war simply because they have r@@ ar@@ ely been in power.
If they were em@@ power@@ ed as leader@@ s, the conditions of an an@@ arch@@ ic world would force them to make the same bel@@ li@@ co@@ se decisions that men do@@ .
M@@ arg@@ ar@@ et That@@ ch@@ er, Gol@@ da M@@ ei@@ r@@ , and Indi@@ ra G@@ and@@ h@@ i were powerful wom@@ en; all of them led their countries to war.
But it is also true that these women ro@@ se to leadership by pla@@ ying according to the political rules of “@@ a man@@ ’s world@@ .”
It was their success in con@@ form@@ ing to m@@ ale values that enab@@ led their rise to leadership in the first plac@@ e.
In a world in which women held a propor@@ tion@@ ate share (@@ one-@@ hal@@ f@@ ) of leadership posi@@ tions, they might be@@ have differ@@ ently in power.
So we are left with the broader ques@@ tion@@ : does gender really matter in leader@@ ship@@ ?
In terms of ster@@ e@@ o@@ typ@@ es, various psych@@ ological stu@@ dies show that men gra@@ vit@@ ate to the hard power of comm@@ and, while women are coll@@ abor@@ ative and in@@ tu@@ i@@ tively understand the soft power of attrac@@ tion and persu@@ a@@ sion.
Americans tend to descri@@ be leadership with t@@ ough m@@ ale ster@@ e@@ o@@ typ@@ es, but recent leadership stu@@ dies show increased success for what was once considered a “@@ f@@ emin@@ ine sty@@ le@@ .”
In inform@@ ation@@ -@@ based socie@@ ties, net@@ works are re@@ plac@@ ing hier@@ arch@@ i@@ es, and knowledge workers are less de@@ fer@@ enti@@ al.
Man@@ a@@ gement in a wide range of organizations is changing in the direc@@ tion of “@@ shared leader@@ ship@@ ,” and “@@ distri@@ but@@ ed leader@@ ship@@ ,” with leaders in the center of a cir@@ cle rather than at@@ op a p@@ y@@ ra@@ mi@@ d.
For@@ mer Go@@ o@@ g@@ le CE@@ O E@@ ri@@ c Sch@@ mid@@ t said that he had to “@@ co@@ d@@ d@@ le@@ ” his employ@@ e@@ es.
Even the military faces these chan@@ ges.
In the United States, the P@@ ent@@ ag@@ on sa@@ ys that Ar@@ my dri@@ ll@@ ma@@ st@@ ers do “@@ less sh@@ ou@@ ting at every@@ on@@ e@@ ,” because today’s generation respon@@ ds better to in@@ struc@@ tors who play “@@ a more coun@@ sel@@ ing-@@ type ro@@ le@@ .”
Milit@@ ary success against terror@@ ists and counter@@ insur@@ g@@ ents requires soldi@@ ers to win hear@@ ts and min@@ ds, not just break buil@@ d@@ ings and bo@@ dies@@ .
For@@ mer US President George W. Bush once descri@@ bed his role as “the deci@@ der@@ ,” but there is much more to modern leadership than th@@ at.
Mo@@ dern leaders must be able to use net@@ work@@ s, to coll@@ abor@@ ate, and to encourage particip@@ ation.
W@@ om@@ en’s non-@@ hier@@ arch@@ ical style and relation@@ al skill@@ s f@@ it a leadership need in the new world of know@@ led@@ ge-@@ based organizations and groups that men, on aver@@ age, are less well prepared to me@@ et.
In the past@@ , when women f@@ ought their way to the top of organiz@@ ations, they often had to adop@@ t a “@@ mas@@ cul@@ ine sty@@ le@@ ,” viol@@ ating the broader social nor@@ m of f@@ em@@ ale “@@ ni@@ c@@ en@@ ess@@ .”
N@@ ow, however, with the information revolution and democrati@@ zation dem@@ anding more particip@@ atory leader@@ ship, the “@@ f@@ emin@@ ine sty@@ le@@ ” is becoming a path to more effective leader@@ ship.
In order to lead success@@ ful@@ ly, men will not only have to value this style in their women colle@@ agu@@ es, but will also have to ma@@ ster the same skill@@ s.
That is a tren@@ d, not (@@ y@@ et@@ ) a fac@@ t.
W@@ om@@ en still lag in leadership posi@@ tions, holding only 5% of top corporate posi@@ tions and a min@@ ority of posi@@ tions in elected legis@@ lat@@ ures (@@ just 1@@ 6% in the US, for example, compared to 4@@ 5% in S@@ w@@ ed@@ en@@ ).
One study of the 1,@@ 9@@ 4@@ 1 rul@@ ers of independent countries during the twenti@@ eth century found only 2@@ 7 wom@@ en, roughly half of whom came to power as wi@@ dow@@ s or dau@@ gh@@ ters of a m@@ ale rul@@ er.
L@@ ess than 1% of twenti@@ eth@@ -@@ century rul@@ ers were women who gain@@ ed power on their ow@@ n.
So, given the new conventional wis@@ dom in leadership stu@@ dies that ent@@ ering the information age means ent@@ ering a wom@@ an’s world, why are women not doing bet@@ ter@@ ?
L@@ ack of experi@@ ence, primary car@@ egi@@ ver responsi@@ bili@@ ties, bar@@ gain@@ ing sty@@ le, and pla@@ in old discrimin@@ ation all help to explain the gender g@@ ap@@ .
Tradi@@ tional car@@ e@@ er pa@@ th@@ s, and the cultural nor@@ ms that construc@@ ted and rein@@ forced them, simply have not enab@@ led women to gain the skill@@ s required for top leadership posi@@ tions in many organiz@@ ational con@@ tex@@ ts.
Res@@ ear@@ ch shows that even in democratic socie@@ ties, women face a higher social risk than men when attemp@@ ting to negoti@@ ate for car@@ e@@ er-@@ related resources such as compens@@ ation.
W@@ om@@ en are generally not well integ@@ rated into m@@ ale net@@ works that domin@@ ate organiz@@ ations, and gender ster@@ e@@ o@@ typ@@ es still h@@ amp@@ er women who try to over@@ come such bar@@ rier@@ s.
This bi@@ as is beginning to break down in inform@@ ation@@ -@@ based socie@@ ties, but it is a mist@@ ake to identi@@ fy the new type of leadership we need in an information age simply as “@@ a wom@@ an’s world@@ .”
Even positive ster@@ e@@ o@@ typ@@ es are bad for wom@@ en, men, and effective leader@@ ship.
Le@@ a@@ ders should be viewed less in terms of her@@ o@@ ic comm@@ and than as encoura@@ ging particip@@ ation throughout an organiz@@ ation, group@@ , country, or net@@ work.
Qu@@ es@@ tions of appropriate style – when to use hard and soft skill@@ s – are equally relevant for men and wom@@ en, and should not be cl@@ ou@@ ded by traditional gender ster@@ e@@ o@@ typ@@ es.
In some circum@@ st@@ ances, men will need to act more “@@ like wom@@ en@@ ”@@ ; in other@@ s, women will need to be more “@@ like men@@ .”
The key choic@@ es about war and peace in our future will depend not on gen@@ der, but on how leaders comb@@ ine har@@ d@@ - and so@@ f@@ t-@@ power skill@@ s to produce sm@@ art strategi@@ es.
Both men and women will make those decision@@ s.
But P@@ in@@ ker is probably correc@@ t when he no@@ tes that the parts of the world that lag in the decline of violence are also the parts that lag in the em@@ power@@ ment of wom@@ en.
Most com@@ ment@@ ators ro@@ ut@@ in@@ ely assu@@ me that a Y@@ es vote in the Ma@@ y 2@@ 9 French refer@@ endum on the proposed European Union Constitu@@ tion would be good for Europe and the EU.
But there is reason to doubt the conventional wis@@ dom@@ .
The French refer@@ endum will determin@@ e the political f@@ ate of French President J@@ acqu@@ es Chi@@ ra@@ c – not Franc@@ e’s commitment to Europe, which is fix@@ ed and im@@ mut@@ able.
If the French vote No@@ , M@@ . Chi@@ ra@@ c is fin@@ ish@@ ed.
If they vote Y@@ es, he is re-@@ em@@ power@@ ed.
Europe clearly would be better off with Chi@@ ra@@ c weak@@ ened than strength@@ en@@ ed, even if it means a temporary slow@@ ing of the p@@ ace of integra@@ tion.
Chi@@ ra@@ c practi@@ ces the politics of “@@ sc@@ ap@@ e@@ go@@ ati@@ sm@@ ” and exc@@ us@@ es.
According to Chi@@ rac@@ , Franc@@ e’s exports are lag@@ ging not because France is los@@ ing its international competi@@ tiveness – although it is, especially to Germany – but because of the strong euro@@ .
Likewise, Franc@@ e’s economic growth is wan@@ ing not because France has failed to under@@ take necessary structural reform@@ s, but because European interest rates are too high@@ .
Wh@@ o does Chi@@ ra@@ c think is at f@@ aul@@ t?
The European Central Bank, of course, for allow@@ ing the euro to appreci@@ ate too much and for not cutting interest rates enough@@ .
Unfortunately, this is typ@@ ical of Chi@@ rac@@ ’s leadership sty@@ le@@ : blam@@ e other@@ s, exc@@ use y@@ our@@ self@@ , and ignor@@ e reform@@ .
This is hardly the type of leadership Europe needs to survi@@ ve and prosp@@ er in the modern world.
But Europe will get more of it if the French vote Y@@ es.
Europe also would continue to be domin@@ ated by the interests of the big countries, with the small countries in the back of the bus@@ .
The f@@ ate of the Fran@@ co-@@ German a@@ x@@ is, in particul@@ ar, h@@ ing@@ es on the outcome of the refer@@ end@@ um.
A Y@@ es in@@ vi@@ g@@ or@@ ates the a@@ x@@ is@@ ; a No weak@@ ens it.
“@@ Wh@@ o would follow Chi@@ ra@@ c if the French vote No@@ ?@@ ” asked one EU am@@ b@@ ass@@ ad@@ or in a recent inter@@ view@@ . “@@ Even Ber@@ lin has op@@ tions@@ .”
But Ber@@ lin would not like a No vo@@ te.
If Chi@@ ra@@ c goes dow@@ n, German Chanc@@ ell@@ or Ger@@ hard Sch@@ ro@@ e@@ der los@@ es face as well. Two bir@@ ds would be wo@@ unded with one st@@ one.
The prospect of a re-@@ energi@@ zed Fran@@ co-@@ German a@@ xis is why the D@@ ut@@ ch – who are tradition@@ ally pro-@@ European but do not want a Europe that margin@@ aliz@@ es small countries – might vote No in their refer@@ endum (@@ which follow@@ s shor@@ tly upon Franc@@ e@@ ’@@ s) if the French vote Y@@ es.
A D@@ ut@@ ch No would sign@@ al rejec@@ tion of a corpor@@ ati@@ st Europe domin@@ ated by French and German interest@@ s, as well as represent@@ ing a pro@@ test against the un@@ popular conservative and mor@@ alisti@@ c policies of the Bal@@ k@@ en@@ ende government.
France is not the only EU country with an un@@ popular leader@@ .
Eastern Europe also has a big st@@ ake in the outcome of the French refer@@ end@@ um.
Chi@@ ra@@ c made it perf@@ ec@@ tly clear how he fe@@ els about the new smaller countries when he told them to “@@ sh@@ ut up@@ ” when they dis@@ agreed with him over Iraq.
More rec@@ ently, Chi@@ rac@@ ’s foreign minister, Mich@@ el Bar@@ ni@@ er, ch@@ as@@ ti@@ sed the Rom@@ ani@@ an President Tra@@ ian Bar@@ es@@ c@@ u for lack@@ ing a “@@ European ref@@ lex@@ ,” because Bar@@ es@@ c@@ u plans to ali@@ g@@ n Rom@@ ani@@ a with Ang@@ lo@@ -S@@ a@@ x@@ on liberal economic policies, and wants a special relationship with the US and U@@ K to improve security in the B@@ lack Se@@ a region.
Ra@@ ther than bu@@ ck@@ le to Franc@@ e’s will, however, the Rom@@ ani@@ an president war@@ ned Franc@@ e’s leaders to stop lec@@ turing his country – a s@@ ure sign that French influence is on the wan@@ e even in countries with which it has had close historical ties.
A French No would si@@ t well with the Uni@@ on’s ne@@ wer members from Eastern Europe, who know Chi@@ ra@@ c is not their fri@@ end, and who are more attrac@@ ted by promises of rapid economic growth than social protection and corporate state mi@@ schi@@ ef@@ .
Finally, the refer@@ endum con@@ tains an un@@ st@@ ated question about the future of European Monetary Union (@@ E@@ M@@ U@@ ) and the euro@@ .
The Y@@ es c@@ am@@ p argu@@ es that rejec@@ ting the Constitu@@ tion would damage the European Central Bank (@@ EC@@ B@@ ) and the euro@@ .
But why would the EU fall into cha@@ os and the euro wil@@ t if the Treaty of Ni@@ ce remains in forc@@ e.
In the area of monetary integra@@ tion, the European Constitu@@ tion do@@ es@@ n’t change any@@ th@@ ing, other than the vo@@ ting proc@@ edu@@ res in the Govern@@ ing Council if E@@ M@@ U grow@@ s beyond 15 member countries.
A Y@@ es vo@@ te, on the other hand, would encourage a reas@@ su@@ red Chi@@ ra@@ c to continue his policy of no reform and sc@@ ap@@ e@@ go@@ ating the EC@@ B.
Ex@@ ternal political pressure on the ECB and its president, Je@@ an-@@ C@@ lau@@ de T@@ rich@@ et, to lower interest rates and talk the euro down su@@ rely would increas@@ e.
This is more likely to bring the euro down than a No vo@@ te.
The European Union has been so successful that you would have thought there would be d@@ anc@@ ing in the stre@@ ets at its 50@@ th anni@@ vers@@ ary.
Al@@ as, there has been only persi@@ st@@ ent talk of failure – to achieve political uni@@ on, to adop@@ t a constitu@@ tion, to exerc@@ ise global leadership and vi@@ sion, to imp@@ lement economic reform@@ s, and the list of lam@@ ents goes on. “@@ The EU is on aut@@ op@@ il@@ o@@ t, in stal@@ em@@ ate, in deep crisi@@ s@@ ,” claims J@@ o@@ sch@@ ka F@@ isch@@ er, the former German foreign minister and an important vo@@ ice in Europe.
But this ang@@ st and hand@@ -@@ w@@ ring@@ ing simply is not convinc@@ ing.
Consider German@@ y.
After World War II@@ , it was a be@@ aten and dev@@ ast@@ ated nation with a history of dy@@ sf@@ unc@@ tional nation@@ alism. Today, a tot@@ ally re@@ hab@@ ilit@@ ated Germany is as th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly European and democratic as any other EU nation – indeed, under the leadership of Angel@@ a Merk@@ el, Germany has ear@@ ned its place as Europe’s most important country.
The EU deser@@ ves great credit for this transform@@ ation.
After the W@@ ar, it was a prime EU objec@@ tive to moderate nation@@ alism and promote region@@ alism in Germany, a fe@@ at that was accompli@@ shed to the benefit of all Europe@@ ans.
Sh@@ oul@@ d@@ n’t they – and others – be cel@@ eb@@ rating this major success instead of becoming bo@@ g@@ ged down in defe@@ ati@@ st talk of crisis and stal@@ em@@ at@@ e?
Bes@@ id@@ es, where is the al@@ leg@@ ed crisis and stal@@ em@@ at@@ e?
On the economic fron@@ t, the euro@@ -@@ zone economy per@@ form@@ ed extrem@@ ely well in 200@@ 6, and most exper@@ ts predic@@ t that economic growth in 2007 will be faster in Europe than in the United States, not@@ with@@ standing Germany’s hef@@ ty increase in valu@@ e-@@ added tax@@ .
Even more im@@ pres@@ si@@ ve, the lack of full political union in Europe has not stal@@ em@@ ated the EU’s adop@@ tion of the euro and the common monetary policy.
On the contrary, the qu@@ ick international accep@@ t@@ ance of the euro as one of the world’s pre@@ mi@@ er curren@@ cies, ai@@ ded by the European Central Bank@@ ’s determin@@ ation to keep inflation under contro@@ l, indic@@ ates that the monetary project is going full ste@@ am ahe@@ ad.
C@@ ur@@ r@@ ently, the euro is strength@@ ening against the US doll@@ ar, because central banks in Asia and the Middle East are increasing the euro comp@@ on@@ ent of their foreign exchange reserves – a clear vote of confidence in the new currency and the EC@@ B.
Both the success of the euro and the smo@@ o@@ th func@@ tioning of the common monetary policy show that important “@@ Europe@@ an@@ ” projects can be accompli@@ shed even without the benefit of full political uni@@ on.
While the EU’s member states have pro@@ ved themselves capable of put@@ ting asi@@ de their differences when for@@ ging a common monetary policy, a common foreign policy has pro@@ ved more el@@ usi@@ ve.
On issues like the Iraq war and American plans to inst@@ all missi@@ le def@@ ens@@ es in Pol@@ and and the C@@ ze@@ ch Republi@@ c, Europeans appear to find it difficult to spe@@ ak with a single vo@@ ic@@ e.
The reason is cle@@ ar@@ : Europe remains too dependent on the US for its defense need@@ s.
Some EU members (@@ Germany and Ital@@ y@@ ) are more dependent on the US than others (@@ Franc@@ e@@ ), and thus more likely to support US strategic initi@@ ativ@@ es.
So long as these differences rema@@ in, so will Europe’s political divi@@ sions.
But defense independence vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ v@@ is US implies a vast re-@@ alloc@@ ation of resources from social welfare programs to the milit@@ ary, which so far has not interest@@ ed the Europe@@ ans.
Ra@@ ther than reflec@@ ting a lack of political will to come together and spe@@ ak with a single vo@@ ice on strategic issues – the conventional interpre@@ tation – di@@ verse vo@@ ic@@ es are the result of an implic@@ it choice that Europeans mak@@ e.
Many Europeans have decided that it is better to keep their ro@@ b@@ ust social welfare programs and for@@ go a common foreign and defense policy, which would require massive changes in the European way of life.
Moreover, with the dis@@ appear@@ ance of the Soviet Union as a common thre@@ at, Europe’s le@@ f@@ t-@@ wing parties are increasingly defin@@ ing themselves as anti-@@ Americ@@ an.
Thus, when J@@ os@@ é Z@@ ap@@ ater@@ o and the Soci@@ alists took control of Spain@@ ’s government from the conserv@@ ativ@@ es, the country’s foreign policy changed from suppor@@ ting the Americans in Iraq to op@@ posing them.
(@@ But, interest@@ ing@@ ly, the s@@ wit@@ ch from S@@ il@@ vi@@ o Berluscon@@ i to Rom@@ an@@ o Pro@@ di in Italy is having a less dramatic effect on Ital@@ y’s foreign policy because of the country’s greater defense depen@@ dence on the US@@ .)
Natur@@ ally, with soci@@ alists and social democ@@ rats in power in some EU countries, and conserv@@ atives in power in other@@ s, it is difficult for Europeans to find a single vo@@ ic@@ e.
This may change if a new common threat to Europe emer@@ ges, or if conservative parties follow the left and become anti-@@ Americ@@ an.
Given US President George W. Bush’s extreme un@@ popul@@ arity in Europe, the emer@@ gence of an anti-@@ American right should no longer be considered a remo@@ te possi@@ bilit@@ y.
But with Europe enjo@@ ying an unpreced@@ ented level of economic prosperity as a result of the EU’s dramatic accompli@@ sh@@ ments during its first 50 years, further political uni@@ fication clearly can wa@@ it.
Con@@ g@@ rat@@ ul@@ ations, not hand@@ -@@ w@@ ring@@ ing, should be the order of the da@@ y.
The G-@@ 8 Sum@@ mit in Japan earlier this month was a pain@@ ful demon@@ stration of the pi@@ ti@@ ful state of global cooper@@ ation.
The world is in deep@@ ening crisis.
Fo@@ od prices are so@@ ar@@ ing. O@@ il prices are at histor@@ ic high@@ s.
The leading economies are ent@@ ering a recession@@ .
C@@ lim@@ ate change negotiations are going around in cir@@ cl@@ es. A@@ id to the poorest countries is stag@@ n@@ ant, despite years of promised increas@@ es.
And yet in this ga@@ ther@@ ing stor@@ m it was hard to find a single real accompli@@ sh@@ ment by the world’s leader@@ s.
The world needs global solu@@ tions for global problem@@ s, but the G-@@ 8 leaders clearly cannot provide them.
Because virtually all of the political leaders that went to the summit are deeply un@@ popular at hom@@ e, few offer any global leader@@ ship.
They are weak individu@@ ally, and even weak@@ er when they get together and disp@@ la@@ y to the world their in@@ ability to mobili@@ ze real ac@@ tion.
There are four deep problems.
The first is the in@@ co@@ her@@ ence of American leader@@ ship.
While we are well past the time when the United States alone could solve any global problem@@ s, it does not even try to find shared global solu@@ tions.
The will to global cooperation was weak even in the Clinton administ@@ ration, but it has dis@@ appe@@ ared entirely during the Bush administ@@ ra@@ tion.
The second problem is the lack of global financ@@ ing.
The hung@@ er crisis can be over@@ come in poor countries if they get help to grow more fo@@ od.
The global energy and climate crises can be over@@ come if the world invest@@ s together to develop new energy technologi@@ es.
Dis@@ eas@@ es such as mal@@ aria can be over@@ come through glob@@ ally coordin@@ ated investments in disease contro@@ l.
The oc@@ e@@ ans, ra@@ in@@ for@@ est@@ s, and air can be kept safe through po@@ ol@@ ed investments in environmental protec@@ tion.
Global solu@@ tions are not exp@@ ensi@@ ve, but they are not fre@@ e, ei@@ ther.
Global solu@@ tions to pover@@ ty, food produc@@ tion, and development of new cle@@ an energy technology will require annual investments of roughly $@@ 3@@ 50 billi@@ on, or 1% of G@@ N@@ P of the rich world.
This is ob@@ viously aff@@ ord@@ able, and is mo@@ dest compared to military spend@@ ing, but is far above the p@@ it@@ t@@ ance that the G-@@ 8 actually br@@ ings to the table to solve these urg@@ ent challen@@ ges.
British Prime Minister G@@ ord@@ on B@@ rown has made a v@@ ali@@ ant effort to get the rest of Europe to hon@@ or the mo@@ dest aid p@@ led@@ ges made at the G-@@ 8 Sum@@ mit in 200@@ 5, but it has been a t@@ ough figh@@ t, and one that h@@ as@@ n’t been w@@ on.
The third problem is the dis@@ connec@@ tion between global scientific exper@@ ti@@ se and politici@@ ans.
S@@ ci@@ enti@@ sts and engine@@ ers have developed many powerful ways to address today’s challen@@ ges, whether growing fo@@ od, controll@@ ing diseas@@ es, or protec@@ ting the environ@@ ment.
And these metho@@ ds have become even more powerful in recent years with adv@@ ances in information and communic@@ ations technolog@@ y, which make global solu@@ tions easier to identi@@ fy and imp@@ lement than ever befor@@ e.
The fo@@ ur@@ th problem is that the G-@@ 8 ignor@@ es the very international institutions – not@@ ably the United Nations and the World Bank – that offer the best hope to imp@@ lement global solu@@ tions.
These institutions are often de@@ priv@@ ed of political back@@ ing, under@@ financ@@ ed, and then blam@@ ed by the G-@@ 8 when global problems ar@@ en@@ ’t solv@@ ed.
Instead, they should be given clear authority and responsi@@ bili@@ ties, and then held accoun@@ table for their performan@@ ce.
President Bush may be too un@@ aw@@ are to recognize that his histor@@ ically high 7@@ 0% dis@@ appro@@ val rating among US voters is related to the fact that his government turned its back on the international community – and thereby go@@ t tra@@ pped in war and economic crisis.
The other G-@@ 8 leaders pres@@ um@@ ably can see that their own un@@ popul@@ arity at home is stron@@ gly related to high food and energy prices, and an increasingly un@@ stable global climate and global economy, n@@ one of which they can address on their ow@@ n.
St@@ ar@@ ting in Janu@@ ary 2009 with the new US president, politicians should take the best chance for their own political survi@@ val@@ , and of course for their countries’ well-@@ bein@@ g, by rein@@ vi@@ g@@ or@@ ating global cooper@@ ation.
They should agree to address shared global go@@ als, including the fight against pover@@ ty, hung@@ er, and disease (the Millenni@@ um Development Go@@ al@@ s@@ ), as well as climate change and environmental destruc@@ tion.
To achieve these go@@ als, the G-@@ 8 should set clear tim@@ etab@@ les for ac@@ tion, and transpar@@ ent agreements on how to f@@ und it.
The sm@@ ar@@ test move would be to agree that each country tax its CO2 emissions in order to reduce climate change, and then de@@ vote a fix@@ ed amount of the proc@@ e@@ eds to global problem solv@@ ing.
With the funding assu@@ re@@ d, the G-@@ 8 would sud@@ den@@ ly move from emp@@ ty promises to real policies.
B@@ ack@@ ed by adequate fund@@ ing, the world’s political leaders should turn to the exper@@ t scientific community and international organizations to help imp@@ lement a truly global effor@@ t.
Ra@@ ther than regar@@ ding the UN and its agen@@ cies as competi@@ tors or threats to national sovereign@@ ty, they should recognize that working with the UN agen@@ cies is in fact the only way to solve global problem@@ s, and therefore is the key to their own political survi@@ val@@ .
These basic steps – agre@@ eing on global go@@ als, mobili@@ zing the financing needed to meet them, and identi@@ fying the scientific exper@@ ti@@ se and organizations needed to imp@@ lement solu@@ tions – is basic management logi@@ c.
Some may sco@@ ff that this approach is impossible at the global level@@ , because all politics are loc@@ al.
Yet today, all politicians depend on global solu@@ tions for their own political survi@@ val@@ .
That by itself could make solu@@ tions that now seem out of reach com@@ mon@@ place in the future.
Tim@@ e is shor@@ t, since global problems are moun@@ ting rapid@@ ly.
The world is pass@@ ing through the greatest economic crisis in decades.
It@@ ’s time to say to the G-@@ 8 leader@@ s, “@@ G@@ et your act toge@@ ther, or don’t even bo@@ ther to meet next year@@ .” It@@ ’s too em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ sing to wat@@ ch grow@@ n men and women ga@@ ther for emp@@ ty p@@ ho@@ to opportuni@@ ties.
NEW YORK – One od@@ d and dist@@ ur@@ bing asp@@ ect of global politics today is the con@@ fu@@ sion between negotiations and problem@@ -@@ solv@@ ing.
According to a tim@@ et@@ able agreed in Dec@@ ember 2007, we have six months to reach a global agreement on climate change in Copen@@ ha@@ gen.
Govern@@ ments are eng@@ aged in a massive negoti@@ ation, but they are not eng@@ aged in a massive effort at problem@@ -@@ solv@@ ing.
E@@ ach country as@@ ks itself@@ , “@@ How do I do the least and get the other countries to do the mo@@ st@@ ?@@ ,” when they should be as@@ king inste@@ ad, “@@ How do we cooper@@ ate to achieve our shared go@@ als at minim@@ um cost and ma@@ xim@@ um benef@@ it@@ ?@@ ”
These might sound like the same th@@ ing, but they are not.
Ad@@ d@@ res@@ sing the problem of climate change requires reducing emissions of carbon di@@ ox@@ ide from fossi@@ l fuel@@ s, which in turn invol@@ ves choic@@ es in technolog@@ y, some of which already ex@@ ists and much of which needs to be develop@@ ed.
For example, co@@ al pl@@ ant@@ s, if they are to remain a major part of the energy mi@@ x@@ , will need to cap@@ ture and stor@@ e their CO@@ 2, a process called “@@ carbon cap@@ ture and sequ@@ est@@ ration@@ ,” or C@@ C@@ S for shor@@ t.
Yet this technology remains un@@ pro@@ v@@ ed@@ . 
Similarly, we will need renew@@ ed public confidence in a new generation of nuclear power, with plan@@ ts that are safe and reli@@ ably monit@@ or@@ ed.
We will need new technologies to mobili@@ ze lar@@ ge-@@ scale sol@@ ar power, win@@ d power, and ge@@ other@@ mal power.
We might try to ta@@ p bi@@ o-@@ fuel@@ s, but only in forms that do not compe@@ te with food supp@@ lies or with preci@@ ous environmental asset@@ s.
The list goes on.
We will need improved energy effici@@ enc@@ y, through “@@ gre@@ en buil@@ d@@ ing@@ s” and more efficient app@@ li@@ anc@@ es.
We will need to s@@ wit@@ ch from car@@ s with intern@@ al-@@ com@@ bus@@ tion eng@@ ines to hy@@ bri@@ ds, pl@@ u@@ g-@@ in hy@@ bri@@ ds, b@@ at@@ ter@@ y-@@ power@@ ed, and fuel@@ -@@ c@@ ell@@ -@@ power@@ ed v@@ eh@@ ic@@ l@@ es.
A@@ ch@@ iev@@ ing a new generation of elec@@ tri@@ c v@@ eh@@ ic@@ les will require a decade of public and private partner@@ ship to achieve basic technological development (@@ such as improved b@@ at@@ teri@@ es@@ ), a more ro@@ b@@ ust elec@@ tri@@ c gri@@ d, new infrastructure for re-@@ charg@@ ing the autom@@ ob@@ il@@ es, and much more.
Similarly, it will take a decade of public and private investments to demon@@ st@@ rate the fe@@ asi@@ bility of co@@ al-@@ fi@@ red plan@@ ts that cap@@ ture their carbon di@@ ox@@ ide@@ . 
The s@@ wit@@ ch@@ over to new technologies is not mainly a matter of negoti@@ ation but of engine@@ er@@ ing, plann@@ ing, financ@@ ing, and incen@@ tiv@@ es.
How can the world most effectively develop@@ , demonstrat@@ e, and then spread these new technologi@@ es?
Wh@@ ere the benefits are unlikely to acc@@ ru@@ e to private invest@@ ors, who should pay for the early demon@@ stration model@@ s, which will require billi@@ ons of dollar@@ s?
How should we preser@@ ve private incentives for research and development while commit@@ ting to trans@@ fer successful technologies to developing countri@@ es?
These are press@@ ing, un@@ sol@@ ved ques@@ tions.
Yet the global negotiations on climate change are foc@@ using on a different set of ques@@ tions.
The negotiations are mainly about which groups of countries should cut their emis@@ sions, by how mu@@ ch, how fa@@ st, and relative to which bas@@ el@@ ine year.
Coun@@ tries are being pressed to cut emissions by 20@@ 20 by certain percentage targe@@ ts, without much serious discus@@ sion about how the cuts can be achiev@@ ed.
The answer@@ s depen@@ d, of course, on which low-@@ emis@@ sion technologies will be avail@@ able, and on how fast they can be dep@@ loy@@ ed.
Consider the United Stat@@ es.
To cut emissions shar@@ pl@@ y, the US will need to s@@ wit@@ ch over this decade to a new f@@ le@@ et of autom@@ ob@@ il@@ es, power@@ ed increasingly by electric@@ ity.
The US will also have to decide on the renew@@ al and expansion of its nuclear power pl@@ ant@@ s, and on the use of public lands to build new renew@@ able energy pl@@ ant@@ s, especially using sol@@ ar power.
And the US will need a new power gri@@ d to carry renew@@ able energy from low-@@ den@@ si@@ ty population si@@ tes – such as the sou@@ th@@ wes@@ tern deser@@ ts for sol@@ ar power and the nor@@ thern pla@@ ins for win@@ d power – to the high-@@ den@@ si@@ ty popul@@ ations of the co@@ ast@@ s.
Yet all of this requires a national pl@@ an, not simply a num@@ eri@@ cal target for emissions reduc@@ tion.
Similarly, China, like the US, can reduce CO2 emissions through increased energy effici@@ ency and a new f@@ le@@ et of elec@@ tri@@ c v@@ eh@@ ic@@ l@@ es.
But China must consider the question from the v@@ an@@ tage point of a co@@ al-@@ dependent economy.
China’s future choic@@ es depend on whether “@@ cle@@ an co@@ al@@ ” can really work effectively and on a large sc@@ al@@ e.
Thus, China’s emissions path depends cru@@ ci@@ ally on early test@@ ing of the C@@ C@@ S technologi@@ es.
A true global bra@@ in@@ stor@@ m@@ ing approach would first disc@@ uss the best technological and economic op@@ tions avail@@ able, and how to improve these op@@ tions through targe@@ ted research and development and better economic incen@@ tiv@@ es.
The negotiations would disc@@ uss the range of op@@ tions open to each country and region – from C@@ C@@ S to sol@@ ar, win@@ d, and nuclear power – and would sk@@ et@@ ch a tim@@ et@@ able for a new generation of low-@@ emis@@ sion autom@@ ob@@ il@@ es, recogni@@ zing that market competition as well as public financing will set the ac@@ tual p@@ ac@@ e.
Bas@@ ed on these building block@@ s, the world could agree on alloc@@ ating the costs for spe@@ ed@@ ing the development and spread of new low-@@ emis@@ sion technologi@@ es.
This global framework would under@@ p@@ in national and global targe@@ ts for emissions control and for monit@@ or@@ ing the progress of the technological over@@ hau@@ l.
As new technologies are pro@@ v@@ en, the targe@@ ts would become more st@@ ring@@ ent.
Of course, part of the strategy would be to create market incentives for new low-@@ emis@@ sion technologi@@ es, so that inv@@ ent@@ ors could develop their own ideas with the prospect of large prof@@ its if those ideas are righ@@ t.
M@@ y p@@ le@@ a to disc@@ uss plans and strategi@@ es al@@ ong@@ side specific emissions targe@@ ts might seem to risk imp@@ ed@@ ing the negoti@@ ations.
But if we don’t have a strategy to ac@@ company our targe@@ ts, the world’s governments might not accept such targe@@ ts in the first plac@@ e, or might accept them cy@@ ni@@ call@@ y, without any inten@@ tion of actually meeting them.
We need to think har@@ d, and coll@@ abor@@ ati@@ vel@@ y, about the world’s real technological op@@ tions, and then pursue a common global framework that allow@@ s us to move into a new er@@ a, one based on fe@@ asi@@ ble and sustainable technologies for energ@@ y, tran@@ spor@@ t, indust@@ ry, and buil@@ d@@ ings.
T@@ el@@ evi@@ sion and newspap@@ ers continue to tru@@ m@@ pe@@ t every t@@ wi@@ st and turn of global financial markets.
In tru@@ th, however, the big story is the un@@ e@@ erie cal@@ m that has eng@@ ul@@ f@@ ed virtually every major asset cl@@ as@@ s, from stock@@ s to bond@@ s.
Is the whole investment world on Proz@@ ac@@ ?
Con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cy the@@ ories abo@@ und, particularly among the ran@@ ks of financial tra@@ ders, for whom volati@@ lity is like win@@ d to a sa@@ il@@ or.
These tra@@ ders confi@@ d@@ ently fig@@ ure that as long as markets g@@ y@@ rat@@ e, no matter what the direc@@ tion, they can always make mone@@ y.
And, th@@ anks to the rest of us who don’t have the time, inform@@ ation, and sk@@ ill to mat@@ ch wi@@ ts with them, they are mostly righ@@ t.
But, with today’s dor@@ man@@ t markets, the pi@@ ck@@ ings are s@@ lim@@ .
The favor@@ ed bo@@ ge@@ y@@ men of the day are gi@@ ant government invest@@ ors, particularly Asian central banks, with their trilli@@ ons of dollars in asset@@ s.
These super@@ fund@@ s, whose manag@@ ers do not necess@@ arily share the same pas@@ sion for prof@@ it as private invest@@ ors, are said to be squ@@ ee@@ zing the life out of interest rates and exchange rates. “@@ The big Asian central banks are op@@ press@@ ing us@@ ,” one young tra@@ der recently comp@@ la@@ ined to me.
What a difference a decade mak@@ es.
During the 199@@ 0’s, private investors look@@ ed at big@@ , l@@ um@@ ber@@ ing central banks as cas@@ h co@@ w@@ s, long on money and short on financial ac@@ um@@ en.
George Sor@@ os once made a billion dollars off the Bank of Eng@@ land in just an ho@@ ur@@ .
His basic strategy was a standard on@@ e: be@@ t against any central bank that tries to def@@ end an in@@ consist@@ ent macroeconomic policy.
Tra@@ ders did not win every batt@@ le, of cour@@ se.
It was the specul@@ ators whose blo@@ od flow@@ ed in the stre@@ ets when they attack@@ ed Hong Kon@@ g@@ ’s dollar pe@@ g in 199@@ 8@@ .
But over@@ all, bet@@ ting against big government financial institutions pro@@ ved to be a rich@@ ly re@@ war@@ ding bus@@ ines@@ s.
That was the 199@@ 0’s.
Today, many tra@@ ders see form@@ er@@ ly in@@ ept state gi@@ ants as financial gen@@ i@@ us@@ es, capable of t@@ am@@ ing complex financial form@@ ul@@ as and explo@@ iting their sup@@ eri@@ or size and trading information to squ@@ ee@@ ze the life out of currency and interest rate markets.
These be@@ h@@ emo@@ th@@ s’ inn@@ ate conserv@@ ati@@ sm@@ , having cal@@ m@@ ed bond and currency markets, is now having a similar effect on stock@@ s.
Although few acc@@ use Asian central banks of exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly con@@ sp@@ iring to cal@@ m global markets, some say that their common cau@@ tious approach to trading is a form of implic@@ it coll@@ u@@ sion.
As much as we may symp@@ ath@@ i@@ ze with young w@@ oul@@ d-@@ be milli@@ on@@ a@@ ire tra@@ ders, does their story of op@@ pression make any sen@@ se@@ ?
C@@ ould it be true that huge government investors from Asia (@@ not to men@@ tion Russia, Latin America, and the Middle East@@ ) have qui@@ et@@ ly taken control of world market@@ s?
Perh@@ ap@@ s, but the bo@@ ge@@ y@@ man theory seems a b@@ it over@@ b@@ low@@ n.
Y@@ es, the big Asian central banks do si@@ t on almost $@@ 3 trillion in asset@@ s; China’s central bank alone has around a trillion dollar@@ s.
This gi@@ ves them a capital b@@ ase similar to the combined assets of all the world’s major h@@ ed@@ ge fund@@ s.
But this met@@ ri@@ c is very dec@@ ep@@ tive.
H@@ ed@@ ge funds constitu@@ te only a small percentage of overall world financial markets, wh@@ ich, according to a recent study by the Mc@@ K@@ inn@@ se@@ y Global Institu@@ te, now exc@@ e@@ ed $@@ 1@@ 20 trilli@@ on.
And h@@ ed@@ ge fund@@ s, un@@ like banks, can lever@@ age their bet@@ s, borrowing to take on assets many times the size of their capital bas@@ e.
O@@ ther@@ wise, George Sor@@ os and his weal@@ thy fel@@ low investors could not have dre@@ am@@ ed of taking on the Bank of Eng@@ land.
In fact, the explan@@ ation for market cal@@ m probably lies elsewher@@ e.
So, if a con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cy of Asian central banks is not to blam@@ e for the volati@@ lity d@@ rought that is par@@ ching tra@@ der@@ s’ ear@@ n@@ ings, what is@@ ?
Su@@ rel@@ y, today’s low volati@@ lity is partly cy@@ c@@ lic@@ al.
St@@ o@@ ck market volati@@ lity was also very low during the early 199@@ 0’s, before reach@@ ing new pe@@ ak@@ s later in the deca@@ de.
Moreover, financial innov@@ ation and globalization allow markets to spread risk more effectively than ever befor@@ e, plac@@ ing it in the hands of those who can best manage it.
Im@@ pro@@ ved central bank policy is another huge factor@@ .
In the early 199@@ 0’s, the average level of world inflation exc@@ ee@@ ded 30@@ %@@ ; now it is less than 4@@ %.
All of these changes have in turn contribut@@ ed to lower econom@@ y-@@ wide output and consumption volati@@ lity in both rich and developing countries.
They have also contribut@@ ed m@@ igh@@ ti@@ ly to the high general level of asset prices, helping create the vast rich@@ es of which today’s hung@@ ry young tra@@ ders are so je@@ al@@ ous.
So will today’s relative market cal@@ m continu@@ e?
Unfortunately, no@@ .
Toda@@ y’s bra@@ ve new world of financial globalization will almost su@@ rely face severe new st@@ ress test@@ s, remin@@ ding us that rec@@ es@@ sions still happ@@ en.
Fran@@ kl@@ y, although I do not see the fi@@ ve-@@ year@@ -@@ old global expansion coming to an end ye@@ t, there is no question that risks are on the ris@@ e, with output in the United States having slow@@ ed sharp@@ ly in the third quar@@ ter, and central bank@@ s’ hands ti@@ ed by inflation risk@@ s.
Fur@@ ther ahe@@ ad, it is not hard to imag@@ ine geo@@ political inst@@ ability – possibly em@@ an@@ ating from Iran, Iraq, or North Korea – uns@@ ett@@ ling markets.
W@@ hat@@ ever the scenari@@ o that ends the cal@@ m, today’s age of low volati@@ lity will seem like a dist@@ ant dre@@ am to most of us – and a for@@ go@@ tten ni@@ gh@@ t@@ m@@ are for ambi@@ tious financial tra@@ der@@ s.
As the global financial crisis transform@@ s itself in@@ ex@@ or@@ ably into economic crisis and now industrial crisis, the c@@ ry “@@ wher@@ e’s Europe@@ ?@@ ” can be hear@@ d across the EU.
So f@@ ar, B@@ rus@@ sel@@ s’ response has been less than re@@ ass@@ ur@@ ing. 
The European Commission@@ ’s wat@@ ch@@ wor@@ d has been that the integri@@ ty of the Sing@@ le Mark@@ et must be def@@ ended at all cost@@ s, and that it will use its form@@ id@@ able legal powers to ensure that bail@@ ou@@ ts and other state aid by EU governments do not dist@@ ort fair competi@@ tion.
It is a famili@@ ar man@@ tra@@ , and among industri@@ alists the mo@@ od now seems to be har@@ den@@ ing that it is not enough@@ .
With an@@ xi@@ ety moun@@ ting across Europe that industrial la@@ y-@@ off@@ s will mean major pl@@ ant clo@@ su@@ res and cas@@ c@@ ad@@ ing job losses in thousands of smaller compani@@ es, national governments find themselves on a col@@ li@@ sion course with the EU, though they know that their best chance of sal@@ v@@ ation lies in conc@@ er@@ ted European ac@@ tion.
In B@@ rus@@ sel@@ s, there is a@@ war@@ en@@ ess that the crisis offers real political opport@@ un@@ ity, even if the Commission has yet to gra@@ s@@ p it. 
The time has come for a new EU industri@@ al-@@ policy framework that would per@@ mit B@@ rus@@ sel@@ s to use its “@@ hon@@ est bro@@ k@@ er@@ ” status to manage comp@@ eting interest@@ s.
The Commission@@ ’s euro@@ c@@ rats should dust@@ -@@ off their fil@@ es from 30 years ago and rec@@ all how their pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ ors hand@@ led the ste@@ el crisis that then threat@@ ened to provo@@ ke an in@@ tra@@ -@@ European trade war. 
In the late 197@@ 0’s, the Commission declared a state of “@@ mani@@ f@@ est crisi@@ s” and agreed with member governments the de@@ tail@@ s of what came to be called the Davi@@ gn@@ on Plan@@ .
D@@ ra@@ w@@ n up by the Bel@@ gi@@ an member of the Commission who held the industry port@@ f@@ oli@@ o, several of its provi@@ sions are clearly relevant to the current situ@@ ation, not least to the autom@@ ob@@ ile indust@@ r@@ y.
The Davi@@ gn@@ on Plan imposed Europe@@ -@@ wide production and price contro@@ l@@ s, monit@@ or@@ ed and coordin@@ ated national government@@ s’ state a@@ id@@ s, organiz@@ ed the clo@@ su@@ res of out@@ d@@ ated pl@@ ant@@ s, encoura@@ ged mer@@ ger@@ s, and a@@ war@@ ded EU funding to re@@ tra@@ ining schem@@ es for re@@ d@@ und@@ ant ste@@ el work@@ ers.
Its overall a@@ im was to make the back@@ b@@ one of Europe’s heav@@ y-@@ engine@@ ering sector more competitive internation@@ ally.
The plan@@ ’s auth@@ or, Vi@@ com@@ te E@@ ti@@ en@@ ne Davi@@ gn@@ on, recently com@@ ment@@ ed in the Bel@@ gi@@ an press that he can@@ ’t understand why the Commission is not doing something similar today.
“@@ To do so would legitimate national a@@ id@@ s (@@ to car@@ mak@@ er@@ s) but would ensure they are based on a common EU-@@ level strateg@@ y@@ ,” he w@@ ro@@ te.
The sign@@ als from the Commission@@ , though@@ , are not encoura@@ g@@ ing.
In@@ dust@@ ry com@@ mission@@ er G@@ un@@ ther Ver@@ heu@@ gen recently reac@@ ted to calls by both General Mo@@ tors and Ren@@ aul@@ t for a more “@@ pro@@ activ@@ e” EU role in coordin@@ ating bail@@ ou@@ ts by sa@@ y@@ ing@@ : “@@ There will be no sector@@ -@@ specific plans what@@ so@@ ever@@ .” He empha@@ si@@ zed that B@@ rus@@ sel@@ s has neither the funds nor the desire to res@@ c@@ ue the mo@@ tor indust@@ ry, and se@@ es little simil@@ arity between the system@@ ic risks of the financial services sector and the problems faced by the manufacturing bran@@ ch@@ es.
That will be a matter of opinion until the recession beg@@ ins to ab@@ at@@ e; the truth is that we don’t yet know whether this crisis will be a s@@ now@@ ball that grow@@ s la@@ y@@ er by la@@ y@@ er or an a@@ val@@ an@@ che that s@@ we@@ ep@@ s away entire industri@@ es.
In either case, the Sing@@ le Mark@@ et will come under increasing pressu@@ re.
The Commission righ@@ tly sa@@ ys that in this age of globalization there is no longer such a thing as a national car@@ mak@@ er, but there are still national plan@@ ts and national pay@@ ro@@ ll@@ s that politicians facing elections will be des@@ per@@ ate to def@@ end.
It do@@ es@@ n’t really matter whether a new crisi@@ s-@@ be@@ ating EU strategy be@@ ars some res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance to the largely for@@ go@@ tten Davi@@ gn@@ on Plan@@ .
The important point is that Europe should be seen to have set out a common framework for addres@@ sing the slow@@ dow@@ n.
Euro@@ c@@ rats insi@@ st that the necessary policy instru@@ ments and rules are already in plac@@ e, but that is to ignor@@ e political re@@ ality.
Un@@ less the EU’s intern@@ al-@@ market rules can be made more flexi@@ ble, member governments will fl@@ out them.
The crisis has also under@@ s@@ cor@@ ed a lon@@ ger@@ -@@ term need for a more conc@@ er@@ ted EU approach to industrial policy.
There is a growing a@@ war@@ en@@ ess in Europe that the crisis is set to re-@@ shap@@ e our industrial bas@@ e, as Asian countries take over from the EU and the United States many of their advanced technology fi@@ ef@@ dom@@ s.
But Europe’s 10@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old Lis@@ bon strategy to secure global high-@@ te@@ ch leadership is widely dis@@ credi@@ ted, which is a further reason to include a large R@@ &amp@@ ;@@ D comp@@ on@@ ent in any EU-@@ wide industrial program@@ .
Pres@@ ent@@ ation is an essential part of any political proc@@ ess, and it@@ ’s the part where the European Commission is least comp@@ et@@ ent.
Industri@@ al leaders and ordinary citizens ali@@ ke want to be told that the EU is working on a policy approach that looks far@@ ther ahead than the g@@ lo@@ om@@ y pres@@ ent.
Ver@@ ve and fan@@ fare may be ali@@ en to B@@ rus@@ sel@@ s, but what is urg@@ ently required is a sense of political show@@ man@@ ship that restor@@ es confidence in the European project as well as the economy.
D@@ eci@@ pher@@ ing the human gen@@ ome has provided insi@@ gh@@ ts into the nature of human@@ ity, our relationship to the world, and our future.
We now have the set of in@@ struc@@ tions that speci@@ fi@@ es human develop@@ ment@@ --@@ how each of us progres@@ sed from a single c@@ ell (@@ a fer@@ ti@@ li@@ zed eg@@ g@@ ) to an ad@@ ul@@ t human com@@ pri@@ sing a hund@@ red trillion c@@ ells of thousands of different typ@@ es.
So what comes ne@@ x@@ t? 
The genom@@ e@@ 's langu@@ age is D@@ NA@@ , whose al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t has just four different let@@ ter@@ s: G@@ , C@@ , A@@ , and T@@ . But the gen@@ ome con@@ tains three billion of these let@@ ters.
The Hum@@ an Gen@@ ome Pro@@ ject trans@@ l@@ ated them into a `@@ Bo@@ ok of Li@@ fe@@ ,@@ ' that consi@@ sts of 500 volum@@ es, each with 1@@ ,000 p@@ ages aver@@ aging 1@@ ,000 si@@ x@@ -@@ let@@ ter wor@@ ds per pa@@ ge.
Oper@@ ation@@ ally, the human gen@@ ome is com@@ posed of one long sent@@ ence of three billion let@@ ters cut into 2@@ 4 pi@@ ec@@ es@@ --@@ ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es@@ --@@ that range in size from 45@@ -@@ 2@@ 8@@ 0 million let@@ ters. 
In a book@@ , wor@@ ds are collec@@ ted into sent@@ enc@@ es, sent@@ ences into par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph@@ s, and par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph@@ s into ch@@ ap@@ ters.
E@@ ach level provides a hig@@ her@@ , more co@@ her@@ ent level of mean@@ ing.
So, too, with the human genom@@ e.
D@@ NA@@ 's wor@@ ds are gen@@ es, which en@@ co@@ de pro@@ t@@ ein@@ s@@ --@@ the m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ular building block@@ s of life.
Gen@@ es and pro@@ t@@ ein@@ s are, in tur@@ n, ga@@ ther@@ ed into the bi@@ ological system@@ s-@@ - hear@@ t, bra@@ in, k@@ id@@ ne@@ y@@ s, and so for@@ th@@ --@@ that ex@@ ec@@ ute the func@@ tions of life. 
The first dra@@ ft of the human genom@@ e, publi@@ shed in Febru@@ ary 2001, provided four new fundamental insi@@ gh@@ ts.
First, humanit@@ y's Bo@@ ok of Li@@ fe has only 3@@ 0,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ 3@@ 5@@ ,000 different words, or gen@@ es.
This is surpri@@ s@@ ing, because the gen@@ ome of a tin@@ y wor@@ m that had been sequ@@ enc@@ ed earlier con@@ tains about 20@@ ,000 gen@@ es.
How we make do with only one-@@ third more gen@@ es than this simple wor@@ m remains an un@@ answer@@ ed pu@@ zz@@ le. 
Second, there are essen@@ tially no rac@@ e-@@ specific wor@@ ds in the Bo@@ ok of Li@@ f@@ e.
Indeed, the Bo@@ ok of Li@@ fe for two B@@ lack people may diff@@ er more than that for a C@@ au@@ c@@ asi@@ an person and a B@@ lack person@@ .
The conc@@ ept of ra@@ ce is cul@@ tur@@ al, not gene@@ tic@@ . 
Thir@@ d, the Bo@@ ok@@ s of Li@@ fe for hum@@ ans, fis@@ h@@ , f@@ li@@ es, and ye@@ ast con@@ tain a large number of shared wor@@ ds (@@ although the sp@@ ell@@ ings are some@@ what differ@@ ent@@ ).
Many fundamental bi@@ ological systems com@@ posed of these gen@@ es and pro@@ t@@ ein@@ s are remark@@ ably simil@@ ar.
This under@@ s@@ cor@@ es the des@@ cent of all life from a single common anc@@ est@@ or. 
The fo@@ ur@@ th ob@@ serv@@ ation simil@@ arly high@@ ligh@@ ts the inter@@ connec@@ ted@@ ness of all life.
For example, the Bo@@ ok of Li@@ fe for hum@@ ans con@@ tains around 200 gen@@ es deri@@ ved from other organ@@ ism@@ s, contra@@ dic@@ ting the long-@@ held view that all of our gen@@ es are trans@@ mit@@ ted ver@@ tic@@ ally, from gr@@ and@@ par@@ ents to par@@ ents to childr@@ en.
It seems that ev@@ olution also occur@@ s in a h@@ ori@@ zon@@ tal con@@ tex@@ t, in which any living cre@@ at@@ ure can in@@ corporate information from sur@@ round@@ ing organ@@ ism@@ s. 
The knowledge contain@@ ed in the Bo@@ ok of Li@@ fe has cat@@ aly@@ zed par@@ a@@ dig@@ m changes in bi@@ ology and medic@@ ine.
We can now study a bi@@ ological system in terms of how all of its comp@@ on@@ ents inter@@ act rather than one gene or one pro@@ t@@ ein at a time.
Indeed, the Institu@@ te for Systems Bi@@ olog@@ y, which I co-@@ fo@@ unded two years ago, reflects my con@@ vic@@ tion that systems approach@@ es will domin@@ ate bi@@ ological study in the 2@@ 1@@ st century. 
The par@@ a@@ dig@@ m change in medic@@ ine will be simil@@ arly radic@@ al.
The next 10@@ -@@ 15 years will see a shift away from our current re@@ active model@@ --@@ you come in when you get si@@ ck and the physi@@ ci@@ an attemp@@ ts to make you well@@ --@@ to a predic@@ tive, pre@@ ven@@ tive, and ultimately a person@@ alized form of medic@@ ine. 
For example, if you are a wom@@ an with a single bad co@@ p@@ y of the bre@@ ast canc@@ er 1 gen@@ e, you have a 7@@ 0% chance of getting bre@@ ast canc@@ er by the time you are 60 years ol@@ d.
Why only a 7@@ 0% chan@@ c@@ e?
In some cas@@ es, def@@ ec@@ tive gen@@ es require certain environmental sign@@ als to be activ@@ ated, while ano@@ ther, more lik@@ el@@ y, explan@@ ation is that single def@@ ec@@ tive gen@@ es are not enough to cause diseas@@ e; a number of def@@ ec@@ tive gen@@ es must act in conc@@ ert. 
The important point is that within the next 10@@ -@@ 15 years we will have identi@@ fied hundreds of gen@@ es that pre@@ dis@@ pose individuals to virtually all of the com@@ mon@@ , lat@@ e-@@ on@@ set diseas@@ es, such as canc@@ er and car@@ di@@ o@@ v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar, ne@@ uro@@ logi@@ c@@ al, and met@@ ab@@ oli@@ c diseas@@ es.
We will be able to take a blo@@ od s@@ amp@@ le, determin@@ e the possibility of genetic def@@ ec@@ ts, and create a prob@@ abili@@ stic health history of what is likely to happ@@ en.
Ph@@ ysi@@ ci@@ ans will be able to study your gen@@ es in the con@@ text of the bi@@ ological systems within which they oper@@ ate and learn how to circum@@ v@@ ent the limit@@ ations they im@@ po@@ se. 
The predic@@ tive, pre@@ ven@@ tive and person@@ alized medic@@ ine of the future could include changes in environ@@ ment, speci@@ ally designed dru@@ g@@ s, gene engine@@ er@@ ing, and em@@ br@@ y@@ on@@ ic stem c@@ ell@@ s.
All of this will pro@@ pe@@ l us into a very different world, one that may well ex@@ tend hum@@ ans@@ ' life sp@@ an by 10@@ -@@ 30 years, pres@@ enting enormous opportuni@@ ties, but also confron@@ ting us with fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating and per@@ p@@ lex@@ ing eth@@ ic@@ al, soci@@ al, and legal issu@@ es. 
H@@ ow, for example, can we cap@@ ture the enormous potential increase in cre@@ ativ@@ ity and productivity if the average human life sp@@ an is exten@@ ded into the 9@@ 0@@ 's or even be@@ y@@ ond@@ ?
Wh@@ o ge@@ ts to know about predic@@ tive health histori@@ es?
Will we per@@ mit doc@@ tr@@ in@@ a@@ ire religious views to blo@@ ck our ability to ex@@ pl@@ or@@ e the enormous potential of em@@ br@@ y@@ on@@ ic stem c@@ ells and thereby li@@ ft the y@@ ok@@ e of disease from tens of millions of peop@@ le@@ ?
These questions under@@ s@@ core our oblig@@ ation to keep ab@@ re@@ ast of adv@@ ances in science and technolog@@ y, so that we may use the opportunities they provide to better hum@@ ank@@ in@@ d while de@@ aling though@@ t@@ fully and ration@@ ally with the challenges they pres@@ ent. 
CAMBRIDGE – The world economy will shr@@ in@@ k this year for the first time since 194@@ 5, and some economists wor@@ ry that the current crisis could sp@@ ell the beginning of the end of globaliz@@ ation.
H@@ ard economic times are cor@@ related with protection@@ ism, as each country blam@@ es others and protec@@ ts its domestic job@@ s.
In the 193@@ 0’s, such “@@ beg@@ g@@ ar-@@ th@@ y-@@ neighbor@@ ” policies wor@@ sen@@ ed the situ@@ ation.
Un@@ less political leaders res@@ ist such respon@@ ses, the past could become the future.
Iron@@ ically, however, such a gri@@ m prospect would not mean the end of globaliz@@ ation, defin@@ ed as the increase in worldwide net@@ works of inter@@ depen@@ dence.
Glob@@ alization has several di@@ men@@ sions, and, though economists all too often por@@ tra@@ y it and the world economy as being one and the sam@@ e, other forms of globalization also have significant effects – not all of them ben@@ ig@@ n – on our da@@ ily li@@ ves.
The ol@@ dest form of globalization is environ@@ ment@@ al.
For example, the first sm@@ all@@ po@@ x epi@@ dem@@ ic was rec@@ or@@ ded in Egypt in 1@@ 3@@ 50 B@@ C@@ .
It reached China in 4@@ 9 A@@ D@@ , Europe after 7@@ 00@@ , the Americ@@ as in 15@@ 20@@ , and Australi@@ a in l@@ 7@@ 8@@ 9.
B@@ ub@@ on@@ ic pl@@ agu@@ e, or the B@@ lack De@@ a@@ th, origin@@ ated in Asia, but its spread killed a quar@@ ter to a third of Europe’s population in the fo@@ ur@@ te@@ enth century.
Europeans car@@ ried diseas@@ es to the Americ@@ as in the fi@@ f@@ te@@ enth and si@@ x@@ te@@ enth cent@@ uri@@ es that destro@@ yed up to 9@@ 5% of the indi@@ gen@@ ous popul@@ ation.
In 19@@ 18@@ , a fl@@ u pan@@ dem@@ ic caused by a bir@@ d vi@@ ru@@ s killed some 40 million people around the world, far more than the recently conclu@@ ded world war.
Some scientists today predic@@ t a repe@@ at of an avi@@ an fl@@ u pan@@ dem@@ ic@@ .
Since 197@@ 3, 30 pre@@ viously unk@@ now@@ n infec@@ tious diseas@@ es have emer@@ ge@@ d, and other famili@@ ar diseas@@ es have spread geo@@ graph@@ ically in new@@ , dru@@ g-@@ resist@@ ant form@@ s.
In the 20 years after HIV@@ /@@ AIDS was identi@@ fied in the 198@@ 0’s it killed 20 million people and infec@@ ted another 40 million around the world.
Some exper@@ ts project that that number will dou@@ ble by 201@@ 0.
The spread of foreign spec@@ ies of fl@@ or@@ a and fa@@ un@@ a to new areas has wi@@ p@@ ed out n@@ ative speci@@ es, and may result in economic losses of several hund@@ red billion dollars per year.
Global climate change will aff@@ ect the lives of people every@@ wher@@ e.
Th@@ ous@@ ands of scientists from more than 100 countries recently repor@@ ted that there is new and strong evidence that most of the warming obser@@ ved over the last 50 years is at@@ tri@@ but@@ able to human activi@@ ties, and average global tem@@ perat@@ ures in the twent@@ y-@@ first century are projec@@ ted to increase between 2.@@ 5 and 10 degre@@ es F@@ ahr@@ en@@ heit.
The result could be more severe vari@@ ations in clim@@ ate, with too much water in some regions and not enough in others.
The effects will include stronger stor@@ m@@ s, hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es, and flo@@ od@@ s, deep@@ er d@@ rough@@ ts, and more lands@@ li@@ d@@ es.
R@@ is@@ ing tem@@ perat@@ ures have l@@ eng@@ th@@ ened the fre@@ e@@ z@@ e-@@ free se@@ as@@ on in many region@@ s, and gl@@ aci@@ ers are mel@@ t@@ ing.
The rate at which the se@@ a level ro@@ se in the last century was ten times faster than the average rate over the last three m@@ illenni@@ a.
Th@@ en there is military globaliz@@ ation, consi@@ sting of net@@ works of inter@@ depen@@ dence in which forc@@ e, or the threat of forc@@ e, is employ@@ ed.
The world wars of the twenti@@ eth century are a case in poin@@ t.
The pri@@ or era of economic globalization reached its pe@@ ak in 19@@ 1@@ 4, and was set back by the world war@@ s.
But, while global economic integration did not re@@ gain its 19@@ 1@@ 4 level until half a century later, military globalization gre@@ w as economic globalization shr@@ ank@@ .
During the Cold W@@ ar, the global strategic inter@@ depen@@ dence between the United States and the Soviet Union was ac@@ ute and well recogni@@ z@@ ed.
Not only did it produce world@@ -@@ stra@@ d@@ d@@ ling alli@@ ances, but either side could have used inter@@ contin@@ ent@@ al missi@@ les to destro@@ y the other within 30 min@@ ut@@ es.
This was distinc@@ tive not because it was tot@@ ally new@@ , but because the scale and spe@@ ed of the potential conflict ar@@ is@@ ing from military inter@@ depen@@ dence were so enor@@ mo@@ us.
Today, Al Qaed@@ a and other trans@@ national ac@@ tors have form@@ ed global net@@ works of oper@@ ativ@@ es, challeng@@ ing conventional approach@@ es to national defense through what has been called “@@ asy@@ mmet@@ ri@@ cal war@@ f@@ are@@ .”
Finally, social globalization consi@@ sts in the spread of peop@@ l@@ es, cul@@ tur@@ es, ima@@ ges, and ide@@ as.
Mig@@ ration is a con@@ cre@@ te examp@@ le.
In the n@@ ine@@ te@@ enth century, some 8@@ 0 million people cros@@ sed oc@@ e@@ ans to new hom@@ es – far more than in the twenti@@ eth century.
At the beginning of the twent@@ y-@@ first century, 3@@ 2 million US res@@ id@@ ents (@@ 1@@ 1.@@ 5% of the popul@@ ation@@ ) were foreign-@@ bor@@ n.
In addi@@ tion, some 30 million visi@@ tors (@@ stud@@ ents, bus@@ ines@@ spe@@ op@@ le, tou@@ ri@@ st@@ s) enter the country each year.
Ide@@ as are an equally important asp@@ ect of social globaliz@@ ation.
T@@ echn@@ ology makes physi@@ cal mo@@ bility easi@@ er, but local political re@@ actions against immig@@ rants had been growing even before the current economic crisis.
The danger today is that short-@@ si@@ gh@@ ted protection@@ ist re@@ actions to the economic crisis could help to ch@@ ok@@ e off the economic globalization that has spread growth and raised hundreds of millions of people out of poverty over the past hal@@ f-@@ century.
But protection@@ ism will not cur@@ b the other forms of globaliz@@ ation.
Mo@@ dern technology means that pa@@ tho@@ gen@@ s tra@@ v@@ el more easily than in earlier peri@@ od@@ s.
E@@ as@@ y tra@@ v@@ el pl@@ us hard economic times means that immig@@ ration rates may acceler@@ ate to the point where social fri@@ c@@ tion exc@@ e@@ eds general economic benef@@ it.
Similarly, hard economic times may wor@@ sen relations among government@@ s, as well as domestic conflic@@ ts that can lead to viol@@ ence.
At the same time, trans@@ national terror@@ ists will continue to benefit from modern information technolog@@ y, such as the Intern@@ et.
And, while de@@ pressed economic ac@@ tivity may slow some@@ what the rate of green@@ hous@@ e-@@ gas buil@@ d-@@ up in the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ her@@ e, it will also slow the typ@@ es of cost@@ ly programs that governments must en@@ act to address emissions that have already occur@@ re@@ d.
So, unless governments cooper@@ ate to stimul@@ ate their economies and res@@ ist protection@@ ism, the world may find that the current economic crisis does not mean the end of globaliz@@ ation, but only the end of the good kin@@ d, leaving us with the worst of all world@@ s.
When Turke@@ y's parli@@ ament voted in Mar@@ ch 2003 against allow@@ ing American troops to open a nor@@ thern fron@@ t against Iraq, Turke@@ y's traditional strategic partner@@ ship with the United States en@@ ded.
The two countries still recognize many mut@@ ual interest@@ s, but now they manage these interests on a far different basi@@ s.
The vote shock@@ ed "@@ old Europe@@ " and the Arab world as much as the Bush administ@@ ra@@ tion.
Europeans who considered Turkey a potential Tro@@ j@@ an hor@@ se for America within the European Union were forced to re@@ consider@@ .
For many Arab@@ s, the vote show@@ ed that Turkey was not an American lack@@ ey and would not cooper@@ ate with American imperi@@ al desig@@ n@@ s, despite close Turk@@ ish@@ -@@ Israeli rel@@ ations.
L@@ on@@ g-@@ si@@ m@@ mer@@ ing dis@@ agreements between Turkey and the US came to a bo@@ il with the emer@@ gence of the Kur@@ ds of nor@@ thern Iraq as the P@@ ent@@ ag@@ on@@ 's main allies in the Iraq War@@ .
The American administration made it clear that military intervention by Turkey in Nor@@ thern Iraq would not be toler@@ ated.
That message was con@@ firm@@ ed on Ju@@ ly 4, 200@@ 3, when American forces ar@@ res@@ ted several Turkish Sp@@ eci@@ al For@@ ces troops in the to@@ w@@ n of S@@ ul@@ aim@@ ani@@ y@@ a, hum@@ ili@@ ating them by put@@ ting s@@ ack@@ s over their head as they took them into cu@@ sto@@ d@@ y.
Only intervention by US Vi@@ ce President Di@@ ck Ch@@ en@@ ey two and a half days later secu@@ red the re@@ le@@ ase of the soldi@@ ers, who were al@@ leg@@ ed to have been plann@@ ing cl@@ and@@ est@@ ine oper@@ ations within the Kur@@ dis@@ h z@@ one.
Despite ongoing ten@@ sions, the Turkish government has been e@@ ager to men@@ d relations with America, as it is an@@ xi@@ ous to have some influence over develop@@ ments in Iraq.
So the authorities respon@@ ded quickly to the Bush administ@@ ration@@ 's requ@@ est for Turkish troops to join the co@@ ali@@ tion, although the idea was still@@ born - rejec@@ ted by both the Kur@@ ds and the Americ@@ an-@@ appoin@@ ted Govern@@ ing Council in Iraq.
America has its own reasons to pat@@ ch up the relation@@ ship.
Turke@@ y's sec@@ ul@@ ar, capit@@ alisti@@ c, democratic order has become especially valu@@ able to the Bush administration as it seek@@ s to inte@@ gr@@ ate the wider Middle East into the world system by liber@@ aliz@@ ing its economy and democrati@@ zing its poli@@ ty.
Thus, America tru@@ mp@@ et@@ ed its continuing support for Turkish membership in the EU, not@@ ably in President Bush@@ 's spe@@ e@@ ch in Jun@@ e at I@@ stan@@ bul@@ 's G@@ al@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay University - at a brid@@ ge that jo@@ ins Asia and Europe.
But serious bilateral problems rema@@ in.
The government is ir@@ rit@@ ated by US occup@@ ation forc@@ es@@ ' neg@@ lec@@ t of the nor@@ thern Iraqi bas@@ es of the P@@ K@@ K@@ , the Kur@@ dis@@ h separ@@ ati@@ st insur@@ g@@ ents who have f@@ ought a 15@@ -@@ year war against Turke@@ y.
More bro@@ ad@@ ly, the government reg@@ ards the US as too com@@ plac@@ ent vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ v@@ is Kur@@ dis@@ h political develop@@ ments and un@@ mo@@ ved by Turke@@ y's concerns about Kur@@ dis@@ h indepen@@ dence.
The US, for its par@@ t, is un@@ happ@@ y with the government@@ 's objec@@ tions to un@@ restric@@ ted American use of the In@@ cir@@ li@@ k air@@ b@@ ase in sou@@ the@@ ast@@ ern Turke@@ y, as well as by recent ten@@ sions with Israel.
In the mean@@ time, Turkey is moving closer to the EU, with the government over@@ coming nation@@ alisti@@ c objec@@ tions in the Parli@@ ament to push through comprehensive reform@@ s.
Turkey also show@@ ed its good will over C@@ yp@@ rus@@ , remo@@ ving a n@@ ag@@ ging political ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le to EU member@@ ship.
These steps led to the European Commission@@ 's recent re@@ commen@@ d@@ ation to begin acc@@ ession negotiations with Turke@@ y.
The EU acc@@ ession process has also under@@ p@@ inn@@ ed a shift in Turkish policy on Iraq.
Pre@@ vi@@ ously, Turkey viewed Iraq sol@@ ely in the con@@ text of its domestic Kur@@ dis@@ h problem.
But widespread European opposition to the war remo@@ ved the possibility of Turkish military interven@@ tion, forc@@ ing the government to develop another vision of Turke@@ y's interest@@ s.
At the same time, the Iraqi Kur@@ ds also appear to appreci@@ ate how much they need a friend@@ ly Turke@@ y.
The nor@@ thern border with Turkey is their li@@ fel@@ ine to the outside world.
As a result, Turkey no longer consi@@ ders a feder@@ alized Iraq a threat to its security, as long as each federal un@@ it main@@ tains a measure of ethnic diversi@@ ty.
Of course, Turkey remains op@@ posed to an independent Kur@@ dist@@ an.
But now its concern is more clo@@ sely ti@@ ed to regional politics than to the Kur@@ dis@@ h issu@@ e.
Turkey has no desire to serve as a strategic counter@@ wei@@ ght to Iran and believ@@ es that only a territori@@ ally in@@ t@@ act Iraq can continue to play that ro@@ le.
Fur@@ ther@@ mor@@ e, Turkey is concerned about the possibility of civil war in Kur@@ dist@@ an between the two largest Kur@@ dis@@ h fac@@ tions.
But, un@@ like either Iran or Syri@@ a, Turkey genu@@ in@@ ely wi@@ sh@@ es to see a strong and represent@@ ative government in B@@ ag@@ h@@ d@@ ad.
Th@@ anks to EU pres@@ sur@@ es, Turke@@ y's domestic Kur@@ dis@@ h problem is well on the way to being resol@@ ved democrati@@ call@@ y, with most Kur@@ dis@@ h leaders in Turkey ex@@ press@@ ing their commitment to Turkish un@@ ity.
For Turkey to consider military intervention in Kur@@ dist@@ an, EU member states would first have to ren@@ ege on their commitment to negoti@@ ate Turkish acc@@ ession@@ .
E@@ qu@@ ally dramatic would be any attempt by the Kur@@ ds to for@@ ci@@ bly change the demograph@@ ic balance of the multi@@ ethnic city of Kir@@ ku@@ k.
Turkey would pre@@ fer that Kir@@ ku@@ k, with its large Turk@@ men popul@@ ation, be given special status in the for@@ th@@ coming dra@@ ft Iraqi constitu@@ tion.
The US also shows sig@@ ns of understanding the importance of maintain@@ ing a multi@@ ethnic Kir@@ ku@@ k and is put@@ ting pressure on its Kur@@ dis@@ h alli@@ es.
Turkish diplom@@ acy has thus become a well-@@ c@@ ali@@ b@@ rated balanc@@ ing ac@@ t, moving closer to European posi@@ tions in the Middle East, but e@@ ager to maintain close relations with the US.
If this approach succe@@ ed@@ s, Europe's brid@@ ge to Asia may also become its brid@@ ge to Americ@@ a.
E@@ lec@@ tions in Russia usually som@@ eh@@ ow sign@@ al a political crisi@@ s: B@@ or@@ is Y@@ el@@ ts@@ in@@ 's re-@@ election as President in 199@@ 6, for example, seemed to hold off a communist res@@ ur@@ rec@@ tion@@ --@@ not by revolution but through the bal@@ lot bo@@ x@@ .
E@@ lec@@ tions to the State D@@ um@@ a (the lower house of Russia's parliament@@ ) are norm@@ ally qui@@ eter affair@@ s, and the just comple@@ ted campaign and D@@ um@@ a elections ( N@@ O@@ T@@ E T@@ O E@@ D@@ I@@ T@@ OR@@ S@@ , the vote is Dec@@ ember 7 th ) were certainly sil@@ ent@@ --@@ de@@ adly sil@@ ent.
Indeed, so om@@ ni@@ po@@ tent is President Vladimir Putin in Russia nowad@@ a@@ ys that the D@@ um@@ a election would have been scar@@ c@@ ely no@@ tic@@ ed@@ --@@ by the world and Russia ali@@ ke@@ --@@ were it not for the ar@@ rest and im@@ prison@@ ment this aut@@ um@@ n of Mik@@ ha@@ il K@@ ho@@ dor@@ ko@@ v@@ sk@@ y, the oil industry oli@@ gar@@ ch who dar@@ ed to put his money behind two liberal parties op@@ posed to Putin@@ .
K@@ ho@@ dor@@ ko@@ v@@ sk@@ y's ar@@ rest did not g@@ al@@ v@@ ani@@ ze ordinary Russi@@ ans, who increasingly see elections as bes@@ ide the point in their difficult li@@ ves.
His ar@@ rest di@@ d, however, sh@@ ake international confidence in Put@@ in, as well as ar@@ ous@@ e Russia's other oli@@ g@@ arch@@ s and democratic reform@@ ers to seri@@ ously fear for their freedom@@ s.
The greater the power, the more dangerous the ab@@ us@@ e, said E@@ d@@ m@@ und Bur@@ ke in 17@@ 7@@ 1.
Putin exerc@@ is@@ es a power greater than that allowed any other democrati@@ cally elected lea@@ der, and the man@@ ner in which he exerc@@ is@@ es it is now caus@@ ing serious conc@@ ern.
L@@ ord Ac@@ t@@ on@@ 's ph@@ ra@@ se about the corrup@@ ting effect of power does not yet ap@@ pl@@ y; Bur@@ ke@@ 's war@@ ning do@@ es.
The presiden@@ cy that B@@ or@@ is Y@@ el@@ t@@ sin created for himself a decade ag@@ o@@ --@@ f@@ atten@@ ed when Y@@ el@@ ts@@ in@@ 's t@@ anks sh@@ ell@@ ed an unru@@ ly D@@ um@@ a in 199@@ 3@@ --@@ gi@@ ves Putin ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing freedom from account@@ ability.
Un@@ like America's or Mexico@@ 's president, he need not c@@ a@@ j@@ ol@@ e a con@@ gress ent@@ ren@@ ched behind the ra@@ m@@ parts of constitu@@ tion@@ ally separ@@ ate power@@ s.
Un@@ like a British or Sp@@ an@@ ish prime minister, he cannot be remo@@ ved by a vote of no confi@@ dence.
Un@@ like German@@ y's Chanc@@ ell@@ or, he is not sh@@ ac@@ kl@@ ed to a coalition partn@@ er who can prevent him going too f@@ ar.
Un@@ like Berluscon@@ i in Ital@@ y, L@@ ula in Braz@@ il, and Ko@@ i@@ zu@@ m@@ i in Japan, he does not have to face down inf@@ igh@@ ting within his own par@@ ty.
To the huge power of the Russian presiden@@ cy Putin ad@@ ds his own alo@@ of temp@@ er and a famili@@ ar@@ ity, from his K@@ G@@ B years, with the sub@@ t@@ le le@@ vers of Russia's bureauc@@ rac@@ y.
N@@ one of this is necess@@ arily wron@@ g@@ : Russia's hard times demand a government that can act deci@@ si@@ vel@@ y.
But Putin@@ 's power is press@@ ing hard against the limits of what is per@@ missi@@ ble in a democracy.
Y@@ el@@ t@@ sin never spread his f@@ ing@@ ers into the no@@ ok@@ s and c@@ ran@@ ni@@ es of government as compreh@@ ensi@@ vely as Putin@@ .
No@@ thing es@@ cap@@ es the ey@@ e of the Krem@@ lin@@ --@@ whether it be which buil@@ d@@ ings are restor@@ ed in S@@ ain@@ t Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g or the appoin@@ t@@ ment of min@@ or Russian en@@ vo@@ ys ab@@ road@@ .
When so much power is concent@@ rated in one plac@@ e, it is temp@@ ting to sti@@ f@@ le critic@@ ism about how that power is us@@ ed.
Most comp@@ la@@ in@@ ts about Putin focus on his efforts to sil@@ ence vo@@ ic@@ es of independent critic@@ ism.
In t@@ am@@ ing the oli@@ g@@ arch@@ s B@@ or@@ is Ber@@ e@@ zo@@ v@@ sk@@ y and Vladimir G@@ us@@ ins@@ k@@ y-@@ -@@ who bal@@ ked at accep@@ ting his "@@ sett@@ lement@@ " wher@@ e@@ by Russia's rich@@ est men would keep their business emp@@ i@@ res@@ , no matter how ill@@ -@@ go@@ t@@ ten, if they kept out of politic@@ s@@ --@@ Putin did ch@@ ok@@ e the media emp@@ i@@ res both men used to promote their caus@@ es.
In a country where the president nam@@ es the head@@ s of all Russia's state tel@@ evi@@ sion and radi@@ o chan@@ n@@ el@@ s, critic@@ ism is not so ab@@ und@@ ant that any of it can afford to be lo@@ st.
But Putin@@ 's press policy does not ad@@ d up to an argument that he ought not to be re-@@ elected next Mar@@ ch, when he stands again@@ .
Indeed, on the great issues of policy, as distinc@@ t from the mur@@ k@@ y cor@@ ners of self-@@ interes@@ t, Putin can still be seen as a good presid@@ ent.
Ab@@ ro@@ ad, he has draw@@ n Russia into ever closer cooperation with the West@@ : in much of the "@@ war on terror@@ " and the handl@@ ing of North Korea, his policy par@@ all@@ els that of Americ@@ a@@ ; elsewher@@ e, rhetor@@ ic about "@@ indepen@@ den@@ c@@ e@@ " persi@@ sts, but the real doub@@ ts about who is a reli@@ able partn@@ er for the West now point to Sch@@ ro@@ eder@@ 's Germany more than to Putin@@ 's Russia.
At hom@@ e, Putin has mostly done the right things for Russia's economy, leaving his government in office long enough to rea@@ p the benefits of consist@@ enc@@ y.
His idea of a "@@ dictator@@ ship of law@@ " sati@@ s@@ fi@@ es enough Russians to put him soli@@ dly in comm@@ and of the political cent@@ er.
What is wor@@ r@@ ying about Putin@@ 's rule is his in@@ ability to make Russia's government more transpar@@ ent.
All de@@ als are priv@@ ate.
La@@ ws appear as if by ma@@ gi@@ c.
No one knows if the president order@@ ed K@@ ho@@ dor@@ ko@@ v@@ sk@@ y's ar@@ rest or even considered the dev@@ a@@ stat@@ ing impact it would inevit@@ ably have on investment in Russia.

NEW YORK – Se@@ x cri@@ me has a t@@ ell@@ t@@ ale sig@@ natu@@ re, even when those direc@@ ting the ou@@ tra@@ ges are some of the most powerful men and women in the United Stat@@ es.
How extra@@ ordin@@ ary, then, to learn that one of the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors of these cri@@ m@@ es, Con@@ d@@ ol@@ ee@@ zz@@ a R@@ ic@@ e, has just led the debate in a special s@@ ession of the United Nations Security Council on the use of s@@ ex@@ ual violence as a weap@@ on of war.
I had a sense of d@@ é@@ j@@ à v@@ u when I saw the p@@ ho@@ to@@ s that emerg@@ ed in 2004 from Ab@@ u G@@ h@@ ra@@ i@@ b prison@@ .
Even as the Bush administration was sp@@ inn@@ ing the no@@ tion that the tor@@ ture of prison@@ ers was the work of “@@ a few bad ap@@ pl@@ es” low in the military hier@@ arch@@ y, I k@@ new that we were se@@ eing evidence of a system@@ ic policy set at the top@@ .
It@@ ’s not that I am a gen@@ i@@ us.
It@@ ’s simply that, having worked at a rap@@ e crisis center and been tra@@ ined in the basi@@ cs of se@@ x cri@@ me, I have learned that all se@@ x pre@@ d@@ ators go about things in certain recogni@@ z@@ able way@@ s.
We now know that the tor@@ ture of prison@@ ers was the result of a policy set in the Wh@@ ite Hous@@ e by former Secretary of Def@@ ense D@@ onald R@@ ums@@ fel@@ d, Vi@@ ce President Di@@ ck Ch@@ ene@@ y, and Ri@@ ce – who actually ch@@ ai@@ red the tor@@ ture me@@ et@@ ings.
The P@@ ent@@ ag@@ on has also acknow@@ led@@ ged that it had authori@@ zed s@@ exu@@ alized ab@@ use of de@@ tain@@ e@@ es as part of inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation practi@@ ces to be per@@ form@@ ed by f@@ em@@ ale oper@@ ativ@@ es.
And docum@@ ents ob@@ tain@@ ed by the American C@@ i@@ vi@@ l Liber@@ ties Union have R@@ ums@@ fel@@ d, in his own words, “@@ ch@@ ec@@ king in@@ ” on the s@@ exu@@ alized hum@@ ili@@ ation of prison@@ ers.
The s@@ exu@@ alization of tor@@ ture from the top basi@@ cally turned Ab@@ u G@@ h@@ ra@@ i@@ b and Gu@@ ant@@ á@@ nam@@ o B@@ ay into an organiz@@ ed s@@ ex@@ -@@ cri@@ me ring in which the tra@@ ff@@ i@@ ck@@ ed se@@ x sla@@ ves were US-@@ held prison@@ ers.
Lo@@ ok@@ ing at the classi@@ c S and M nature of some of this tor@@ tu@@ re, it is hard not to specul@@ ate that some@@ one set@@ ting policy was ar@@ ous@@ ed by all of this.
The non@@ s@@ ex@@ ual tor@@ ture that was committed ran@@ ged from be@@ at@@ ings and suff@@ oc@@ ation, elec@@ tro@@ des att@@ ach@@ ed to gen@@ it@@ als, and forced sle@@ ep de@@ priv@@ ation, to prison@@ ers being h@@ ung by the wri@@ sts from the c@@ ei@@ ling and placed in soli@@ t@@ ary con@@ fin@@ ement until p@@ sy@@ cho@@ sis was in@@ duc@@ ed.
These ab@@ uses viol@@ ate both US and international law@@ .
Th@@ re@@ e former military at@@ tor@@ ne@@ y@@ s, recogni@@ zing this bl@@ un@@ t tru@@ th, ref@@ used to particip@@ ate in the “@@ military tri@@ bun@@ al@@ s” – ra@@ ther, “@@ show tri@@ al@@ s” – aimed at condem@@ ning men whose conf@@ es@@ sions were e@@ lic@@ ited through tor@@ tu@@ re.
Th@@ ough we can now debate what the pen@@ al@@ ty for w@@ ater@@ -@@ bo@@ ar@@ ding should be, America as a nation@@ , maintain@@ ing an od@@ d sil@@ ence, still cannot seem to disc@@ uss the s@@ ex@@ ual crimes invol@@ v@@ ed.
Wh@@ y?
It@@ ’s not as if the se@@ x crimes that US leaders either authori@@ zed or toler@@ ated are not star@@ ing Americans in the fac@@ e: the ima@@ ges of m@@ ale prison@@ ers with their head@@ s ho@@ o@@ ded with wom@@ en’s under@@ we@@ ar@@ ; the docum@@ ented repor@@ ts of f@@ em@@ ale US soldi@@ ers dep@@ loy@@ ed to s@@ me@@ ar men@@ stru@@ al blo@@ od on the faces of m@@ ale prison@@ ers, and of military inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ators or contrac@@ tors forc@@ ing prison@@ ers to si@@ mul@@ ate se@@ x with each o@@ ther, to pen@@ et@@ rate themselves with objec@@ ts, or to sub@@ mit to being pen@@ et@@ rated by objec@@ ts.
Indeed, the Milit@@ ary Com@@ mis@@ sions Ac@@ t of 2006 was w@@ ritten de@@ liber@@ ately with lo@@ op@@ hol@@ es that gave im@@ mun@@ ity to per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors of many kin@@ ds of s@@ ex@@ ual hum@@ ili@@ ation and ab@@ us@@ e.
There is also the tes@@ tim@@ ony by f@@ em@@ ale soldi@@ ers such as L@@ yn@@ n@@ die Eng@@ land about comp@@ elling m@@ ale prison@@ ers to ma@@ st@@ ur@@ b@@ ate, as well as an F@@ B@@ I mem@@ o objec@@ ting to a policy of “@@ highly aggressive inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation techni@@ ques@@ .”
The mem@@ o c@@ it@@ es a f@@ em@@ ale inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ator ru@@ b@@ bing lo@@ tion on a sh@@ ac@@ kl@@ ed de@@ tain@@ e@@ e and wh@@ is@@ per@@ ing in his e@@ ar – during R@@ am@@ ad@@ an when s@@ ex@@ ual con@@ t@@ act with a st@@ range wom@@ an would be most offen@@ sive – then sud@@ den@@ ly ben@@ ding back his th@@ um@@ bs until he gri@@ mac@@ ed in pain@@ , and viol@@ ently gra@@ b@@ bing his gen@@ it@@ als.
S@@ ex@@ ual ab@@ use in US-@@ oper@@ ated prison@@ s go@@ t worse and worse over time, ultimately inclu@@ d@@ ing, according to doc@@ tors who exam@@ ined de@@ tain@@ e@@ es, an@@ al so@@ dom@@ y.
All this may sound bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re if you are a normal person@@ , but it is standard oper@@ ating proc@@ ed@@ ure for se@@ x offen@@ der@@ s.
Those who work in the fiel@@ d know that once se@@ x ab@@ us@@ ers control a power@@ less victim@@ , they will inv@@ ari@@ ably push the bo@@ und@@ aries with ever more extreme behavi@@ or.
Ab@@ us@@ ers start by und@@ res@@ sing their victim@@ s, but once that line has been bre@@ ach@@ ed, you are likely to he@@ ar from the vic@@ ti@@ m about or@@ al and an@@ al pen@@ et@@ ration, greater and greater pa@@ in and fear being inf@@ lic@@ ted, and more and more car@@ el@@ ess@@ ness about ex@@ posing the crimes as the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ or@@ ’s in@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions fall a@@ way.
The per@@ pet@@ rat@@ or is also likely to eng@@ age in ever@@ -@@ es@@ cal@@ ating ration@@ aliz@@ ations, often argu@@ ing that the off@@ ens@@ es serve a greater go@@ od.
Finally, the vic@@ ti@@ m is blam@@ ed for the ab@@ us@@ e: in the case of the de@@ tain@@ e@@ es, if they would only “@@ beha@@ ve@@ ,” and conf@@ ess, they w@@ oul@@ d@@ n’t bring all this on themsel@@ ves.
S@@ il@@ ence, and even coll@@ u@@ sion, is also typ@@ ical of se@@ x crimes within a fam@@ il@@ y.
Americans are beha@@ ving like a dy@@ sf@@ unc@@ tional family by sh@@ iel@@ ding se@@ x crimin@@ als in their mid@@ st through sil@@ ence.
J@@ ust as se@@ x crimin@@ als – and the leaders who direc@@ ted the use of rap@@ e and s@@ ex@@ ual ab@@ use as a military strategy – were tried and sent@@ enc@@ ed after the wars in Bosni@@ a and S@@ ier@@ ra Le@@ one, so Americans must hold accoun@@ table those who commit@@ ted, or authori@@ z@@ ed, se@@ x crimes in US-@@ oper@@ ated prison@@ s.
Th@@ rough@@ out the world, this per@@ verse and graph@@ ic crimin@@ ality has added fuel to an@@ xi@@ ety about US cultural and military power.
These ac@@ ts need to be called by their true nam@@ es – war crimes and se@@ x crimes – and people in America need to demand justice for the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors and their victim@@ s.
As in a fam@@ il@@ y, only when people start to spe@@ ak out and tel@@ l the truth about rap@@ e and s@@ ex@@ ual ass@@ aul@@ t can the heal@@ ing beg@@ in.
NEW YORK – Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we@@ ’s election appear@@ s, once again, to con@@ fir@@ m a tru@@ ism@@ : Africa only seems to make international head@@ lines when disa@@ st@@ ers stri@@ ke – a d@@ rough@@ t, a cou@@ p@@ , a war, a gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de, or, as in the case of Robert Mu@@ ga@@ be, gro@@ ss@@ ly in@@ comp@@ et@@ ent government.
But, over the past several years, a number of sub@@ -S@@ ahar@@ an countries have attrac@@ ted unpreced@@ ented inf@@ low@@ s of foreign capit@@ al.
Rec@@ ent global financial tur@@ mo@@ il has only added to Afric@@ a’s all@@ u@@ re, because its fron@@ ti@@ er markets are less vulnerable to international volati@@ lity than are most of the world’s more famili@@ ar emerging economies.
There are three main reasons why many sub@@ -S@@ ahar@@ an countries are per@@ form@@ ing well.
First, high commodi@@ ty prices yiel@@ d win@@ d@@ fall prof@@ its for the region’s leading produc@@ ers of ra@@ w materi@@ als.
Gro@@ wing demand for energ@@ y, met@@ als, and min@@ er@@ als – particularly in China – has driven unpreced@@ ented levels of foreign invest@@ ment.
Even large pension funds are beginning to take no@@ tic@@ e.
Moreover, a large number of Afric@@ a’s poorest countries have benef@@ ited from exp@@ on@@ ential growth in (@@ pri@@ mar@@ ily United Stat@@ es@@ -@@ bas@@ ed@@ ) ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ ro@@ p@@ y.
But, while both of these positive tren@@ ds are likely to continu@@ e, a third positive factor may not prove as du@@ ra@@ ble.
E@@ very year, Afric@@ ans living outside the contin@@ ent sen@@ d roughly $@@ 30 billion to family and fri@@ ends back hom@@ e.
These re@@ mit@@ tan@@ ces are vit@@ ally important for economic stability in several African countries.
An economic slow@@ down in the US and Europe could substanti@@ ally slow this in@@ fu@@ sion of c@@ ash@@ , because immig@@ rants are often the first to lose their jobs when recession fear@@ s take hol@@ d.
At the same time, though Afric@@ a’s fron@@ ti@@ er economies are less vulnerable than other emerging markets to global financial tur@@ bul@@ ence, they are highly vulnerable to political tur@@ mo@@ il closer to hom@@ e.
The three countries that ser@@ ved as p@@ il@@ lar@@ s of regional stability for the past several years – Nigeri@@ a, Ken@@ y@@ a, and South Africa – are now too pre-@@ occup@@ ied with political troub@@ les of their own to provide the peac@@ ek@@ ee@@ per@@ s, re@@ construction fund@@ s, and political pressure that often limit the damage from conflic@@ ts else@@ where in the region.
Most of Nigeri@@ a’s problems are well know@@ n.
Milit@@ ants in the o@@ il@@ -@@ rich N@@ iger Del@@ ta region have at times sh@@ ut down as much as 3@@ 0% of the country’s oil export@@ s, a vital source of state revenu@@ e.
President Um@@ ar@@ u Y@@ ar@@ ’@@ A@@ du@@ a has taken con@@ cre@@ te steps to t@@ ack@@ le eli@@ te@@ -@@ level corruption in Nigeri@@ a, and appears to have made progress toward a comprehensive peace agreement with the Del@@ ta re@@ bel@@ s.
But Y@@ ar@@ ’@@ A@@ du@@ a might soon confron@@ t a big short-term problem.
The country’s National E@@ lec@@ tion Tri@@ bun@@ al, having over@@ turned the out@@ comes of several pro@@ vin@@ cial elec@@ tions, may well annu@@ l the results of last year@@ ’s presidential rac@@ e, forc@@ ing him to run for president all over again@@ .
While Y@@ ar@@ ’@@ A@@ du@@ a could use the good@@ will that he has built up over the past year to win by an even larger marg@@ in, the 9@@ 0-@@ day election campaign would almost certainly trig@@ ger civil un@@ res@@ t, and Nigeri@@ a’s leadership would be too bus@@ y n@@ avi@@ g@@ ating domestic political ri@@ val@@ ries to help stabili@@ ze conflic@@ ts else@@ where in Afric@@ a.
Ken@@ y@@ a’s troub@@ les run de@@ e@@ per@@ .
Soli@@ d economic expansion and one of the world’s fa@@ st@@ est@@ -@@ growing stock markets have not helped the country aver@@ t a deep@@ ening political crisis and moun@@ ting ethnic violence since disp@@ uted presidential election results in Dec@@ em@@ ber@@ .
President M@@ wa@@ i K@@ i@@ b@@ ak@@ i, whom international obser@@ vers acc@@ use of rig@@ ging the vo@@ te, has hin@@ ted at a plan to share power in a unity government, but opposition leader R@@ ail@@ a O@@ d@@ ing@@ a has hear@@ d these promises befor@@ e.
O@@ d@@ ing@@ a worked hard to help elec@@ t K@@ i@@ b@@ ak@@ i in 200@@ 2, only to see K@@ i@@ b@@ ak@@ i ren@@ ege on a similar p@@ led@@ ge.
Despite the al@@ arm@@ ing es@@ cal@@ ation in viol@@ ence, fear@@ s of civil war in Ken@@ y@@ a are probably ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated.
The country’s O@@ range opposition movement has recently won key po@@ sts in parli@@ ament and, for the mom@@ ent, is he@@ ed@@ ing calls for cal@@ m from former United nations Sec@@ re@@ tar@@ y-@@ General K@@ of@@ i Ann@@ an and represent@@ atives of the African Union.
But no one should expect Ken@@ y@@ a to play a stabili@@ zing regional role again any@@ time so@@ on.
The contin@@ ent@@ ’s third p@@ il@@ lar@@ , South Africa, will spend 2008 mi@@ red in an es@@ cal@@ ating political f@@ eu@@ d between Th@@ ab@@ o M@@ bek@@ i, the lam@@ e-@@ duc@@ k president, and J@@ ac@@ ob Zu@@ ma, a former dep@@ ut@@ y who is the new@@ ly elected leader of the ruling African National Congress and the leading candidate to succe@@ ed M@@ bek@@ i, his bit@@ ter ri@@ val@@ , next year.
South Afric@@ a’s cour@@ ts have become a political batt@@ le@@ ground@@ , as M@@ bek@@ i and his allies use corruption charg@@ es to try to cri@@ pp@@ le Zu@@ ma@@ ’s candid@@ ac@@ y.
The resulting political fi@@ restor@@ m may well force Z@@ um@@ a to rely on core support from key allies within the country’s trade union movement and Communist Par@@ ty, challeng@@ ing the political eli@@ te@@ ’s pro-@@ market consensus and provo@@ king debate over the future of South Afric@@ a’s economic policy.
No countries in sub@@ -S@@ ahar@@ an Africa will have the economic hef@@ t and political self-@@ confidence to re@@ place Nigeri@@ a, Ken@@ y@@ a, and South Africa as p@@ il@@ lar@@ s of stability any@@ time so@@ on.
Region@@ al blo@@ cs like the Economic Commun@@ ity of West African States (@@ EC@@ O@@ W@@ AS@@ ), the Sou@@ thern African C@@ u@@ stom@@ s Union (@@ S@@ A@@ C@@ U@@ ), and the East African Commun@@ ity (@@ E@@ A@@ C@@ ) will eventually assu@@ me larger ro@@ les in helping resol@@ ve the contin@@ ent@@ ’s most in@@ trac@@ table diplomatic and economic problems.
But that won@@ ’t happen this year.
There remain many good reasons for investors to take a chance on Afric@@ a’s fron@@ ti@@ er markets.
But it will not necess@@ arily take a d@@ rough@@ t, a cou@@ p@@ , a war, or a gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de to make them think t@@ wi@@ ce.
B@@ E@@ I@@ J@@ IN@@ G – With the lik@@ eli@@ hood of a con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ous sovereign@@ -@@ debt imp@@ lo@@ sion and European bank fail@@ ures great@@ ly reduced by the Greek debt deal and the European Central Bank@@ ’s lending progra@@ m, it is time to look ahe@@ ad.
Wh@@ ere do the European Union, the euroz@@ one, and the EU’s highly in@@ deb@@ ted countries go from her@@ e?
Will Europe be able to ro@@ ll back its welfare stat@@ es’ biggest exc@@ esses without economic dist@@ ress and social un@@ rest top@@ pl@@ ing governments and, in the peripher@@ al countries, undermin@@ ing al@@ read@@ y-@@ ten@@ u@@ ous agreements with credi@@ tor@@ s?
Some good news glob@@ ally will have an impact on how these questions are resol@@ v@@ ed.
The United Stat@@ es’ economy is gradu@@ ally revi@@ v@@ ing, al@@ beit slow@@ ly by the standards of recovery from a deep recession@@ .
China, Braz@@ il, and India have not dec@@ ou@@ pl@@ ed from their custom@@ ers in Europe and North America, and so are slow@@ ing, though a relatively soft land@@ ing is likely if Europe’s recession is as short and mil@@ d as predic@@ ted.
The EU’s economic output and population are larger than that of the US, so the f@@ ate of the 2@@ 7 EU countries is every@@ one’s bus@@ ines@@ s, from New York to New Del@@ hi@@ , S@@ ã@@ o P@@ aul@@ o to Sh@@ ang@@ ha@@ i@@ .
For@@ m@@ ed origin@@ ally as a fre@@ e-@@ trade are@@ a, the eurozone com@@ pri@@ ses 1@@ 7 of the countries. K@@ nit@@ ting together 1@@ 7 di@@ spar@@ ate economies, cul@@ tur@@ es, and institutions was a mon@@ um@@ ent@@ al under@@ tak@@ ing, f@@ rau@@ ght with risk@@ .
The Lis@@ bon Treaty empha@@ si@@ zes un@@ anim@@ ity in decision@@ -@@ mak@@ ing.
With some members in@@ side of the euroz@@ one, and others rema@@ ining outside of it, and with di@@ spar@@ ate economic interests and monetary and fiscal tradi@@ tions even within the euroz@@ one, agreement is difficul@@ t.
That s@@ ets the stage for three broad scenari@@ o@@ s, each with implic@@ ations for the European and global economy, the financial and banking system, and relations between the member states and EU institutions.
In the first scenari@@ o, a more un@@ ited and hom@@ o@@ gene@@ ous Europe emerg@@ es from the crisis, en@@ forc@@ ing greater restric@@ tions on member stat@@ es’ budge@@ ts to reduce appar@@ ent risk@@ .
Ac@@ compani@@ ed by a stron@@ g, broad euroz@@ one, risk of a future currency crisis rema@@ in@@ s.
In the second scenari@@ o, a two@@ - or thre@@ e-@@ tier@@ ed Europe includes a two-@@ tier@@ ed euro@@ , with the weak@@ er countries using a separ@@ ate “@@ euro@@ -@@ B@@ ” currency that can flo@@ at against the stronger economi@@ es’ “@@ euro@@ -@@ A@@ .”
This arran@@ gement would hold out the promise to fis@@ cally st@@ res@@ sed economies that, if they get their act toge@@ ther, they could re@@ join euro@@ -@@ A – and do so more rea@@ di@@ ly than they could from their own curren@@ cy.
In the final scenari@@ o, what emerg@@ es is a more de@@ cent@@ rali@@ zed Europe, with less top@@ -@@ down agreement in areas beyond trade and a sm@@ all@@ er, more hom@@ o@@ gene@@ ous eurozone com@@ posed of the EU’s core economies.
Such a construc@@ t would be far more popular with citizens who are un@@ happ@@ y with the ac@@ cre@@ tion of EU power in B@@ rus@@ sel@@ s and the loss of traditional sovereign@@ ty.
Some current euro members – Greece (and perhaps other@@ s) – would re@@ ver@@ t to national curren@@ cies.
N@@ one of these op@@ tions is eas@@ y; each ent@@ ail@@ s serious difficul@@ ties and great risk@@ s.
E@@ p@@ is@@ o@@ di@@ c mu@@ d@@ d@@ ling through may be the best that can be hop@@ ed for@@ .
For example, how would Greece (or any countr@@ y@@ ) ex@@ it the euro in order to c@@ us@@ hi@@ on the extreme down@@ ward wage adjust@@ ment required to re@@ gain competi@@ tiven@@ ess, and to avoid the severe social un@@ rest that could result from re@@ ining in debt too rapid@@ ly@@ ?
As soon as wor@@ d go@@ t out that Greece was seri@@ ously consider@@ ing such a move – well before it could even generate a new dra@@ ch@@ ma currency – euro bank deposi@@ ts would f@@ le@@ e Greec@@ e.
As a result, Greece would be forced to impose capital contro@@ l@@ s.
Some contrac@@ ts den@@ omin@@ ated in euro@@ s would be subject to Greek law, some to European law, and others – for example, deri@@ v@@ atives contrac@@ ts – to British or US law@@ .
L@@ eg@@ al cha@@ os would resul@@ t.
Yet sti@@ ck@@ ing to the euro and forc@@ ing all of the adjust@@ ments in wages risks greater un@@ res@@ t; indeed, it might merely post@@ p@@ one the inevit@@ able.
Govern@@ ments and the bond market will test the seri@@ ous@@ ness of the new@@ ly agreed fiscal gu@@ id@@ el@@ ines (@@ if they are rati@@ fi@@ ed@@ ).
While talk is t@@ ough now, the history of such agreements does not in@@ sp@@ ire optim@@ ism.
Be@@ fore the financial crisis, even Germany viol@@ ated the EU Stability and Gro@@ w@@ th P@@ ac@@ t’s (@@ S@@ G@@ P@@ ) deficit limit@@ s.
In the US, the 198@@ 0’s deficit limits set by the Gra@@ mm@@ -@@ R@@ ud@@ man@@ -@@ Holl@@ ings law were not me@@ t, and, like the S@@ G@@ P@@ , were re@@ vis@@ ed and exten@@ ded.
A@@ gre@@ ements with@@ , and access to@@ , the International Monetary Fund and Europe’s new bail@@ out f@@ und provide (@@ so@@ ft@@ ) constra@@ in@@ ts.
Re@@ g@@ ardless of how these governance and fiscal issues are resol@@ v@@ ed, or mu@@ d@@ d@@ led through@@ , Europe’s banks remain a th@@ or@@ n@@ y issu@@ e.
With the time aff@@ or@@ ded by the EC@@ B@@ ’s thre@@ e-@@ year che@@ ap lo@@ ans, they have some bre@@ a@@ thing ro@@ om to re@@ build their capital and cle@@ an up their balance she@@ et@@ s.
But, while doing so, they are not likely to be exp@@ anding priv@@ ate-@@ sector lending to support economic growth.
European banks are far more thin@@ ly capit@@ aliz@@ ed, and account for a much larger share of credit exten@@ ded, than banks in the US, where much more lending origin@@ ates in capital markets.
Most large US banks – C@@ it@@ i is an excep@@ tion – pass@@ ed US Federal Reserve st@@ ress tests rec@@ ently, with enough capital to with@@ stand a hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical deep recession (@@ 1@@ 3% unemploy@@ ment, a 2@@ 1% further fall in home prices, and a 50% stock@@ -@@ market decl@@ ine@@ ).
Europe’s st@@ ress tests have been much weak@@ er.
Some sort of Bra@@ dy bond to reduce and ex@@ tend excessive sovereign debt will be necess@@ ary.
We can expect further European tur@@ mo@@ il – from banks, sovereign debt, and social un@@ rest in response to even mo@@ dest wel@@ far@@ e-@@ state ro@@ ll@@ back@@ s – and cl@@ ash@@ ing vi@@ sions, within and among countries, concern@@ ing the desi@@ ra@@ bility of deep@@ er European integra@@ tion.
Europe has come a long way from the days when its leaders pro@@ ph@@ esi@@ ed that the euro would quickly ri@@ val the dollar as a global reser@@ ve curren@@ cy.
Yet no one should wri@@ te off Europe.
It still has great strength@@ s, and, with sensi@@ ble reform@@ s, the EU can survi@@ ve and eventually return to greater prosperity and stabilit@@ y.
But Europe remains closer to the beginning of that process of renew@@ al than to the end.
L@@ A@@ H@@ OR@@ E – Pakistan remains the world’s ne@@ ver@@ -@@ ending ques@@ tion.
As 2010 conclu@@ d@@ es, several out@@ standing issues continue to be@@ de@@ vi@@ l the country.
How they are managed in the year ahead will determin@@ e not only Pakistan@@ ’s immediate future and long-term prospec@@ ts, but also the security of its region and, indeed, much of the world.
It has been said – without ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation – that Pakistan faces an exist@@ ential threat@@ .
The country has not defin@@ ed a co@@ her@@ ent approach towards those who are res@@ or@@ ting to terrorism to adv@@ ance their a@@ gend@@ as, both within Pakistan and ab@@ road@@ .
It remains un@@ committed to the idea of den@@ ying sanc@@ tu@@ aries on its terri@@ tory to Taliban figh@@ ters batt@@ ling American and NATO troops in Afghanist@@ an.
R@@ el@@ ations with India have sou@@ red in recent month@@ s, because Pakistan@@ ’s government is once again lending diplomatic support to the insur@@ gency in Indi@@ an-@@ controlled K@@ ash@@ mir@@ .
D@@ om@@ estic terrorism in Pakistan has taken a heav@@ y human and economic t@@ oll@@ .
It is no longer aimed at official support of United Stat@@ es@@ -@@ led anti-@@ terrorism activi@@ ties.
Sun@@ ni Islamic extrem@@ ists now target min@@ ority groups as well as other Muslim sec@@ ts.
Some 8@@ 00 liberal and Su@@ f@@ i Islamic sch@@ ol@@ ars have died in targe@@ ted kill@@ ings by extrem@@ ist groups who receive financial assistance from lik@@ e-@@ min@@ ded people in the Middle East, and some well-@@ known and mu@@ ch@@ -@@ visi@@ ted Su@@ f@@ i shr@@ ines have been bom@@ be@@ d.
The economy is in sh@@ am@@ bl@@ es, and unable to meet the International Monetary Fund demands for its continued suppor@@ t.
If the IMF ter@@ min@@ ates its current progra@@ m, Pakistan will be unable to service its foreign debt.
Indeed, a senior c@@ ab@@ in@@ et minister suggest@@ ed recently that the international community should wri@@ te off Pakistan@@ ’s deb@@ ts – an amount estimated at $@@ 40 billi@@ on.
The minister of finance forc@@ eful@@ ly re@@ pu@@ di@@ ated the sug@@ ges@@ tion the following da@@ y, indic@@ ating that the government has not developed a consist@@ ent approach towards the fal@@ ter@@ ing economy.
The economy was also b@@ adly hur@@ t by the massive flo@@ ods of 201@@ 0, which caused damage estimated at $@@ 10 billi@@ on.
This damage could lower annual GDP growth by 1@@ -@@ 1.@@ 5% for several years to come.
In the 201@@ 0-@@ 2011 fiscal year, the IMF estim@@ ates that economic output will increase by less than 3% – one-@@ third the rate expected in neighbor@@ ing India and less than half that of Bang@@ lad@@ es@@ h@@ .
S@@ lower economic growth will cause a short@@ fall of jobs for new ent@@ rants to the work@@ forc@@ e, thereby increasing the inci@@ dence of pover@@ ty.
Indeed, the number of people living in absolu@@ te poverty is likely to increase by 10 milli@@ on, bringing the total to more than 70 milli@@ on, or 40% of the popul@@ ation.
Pakistan thus ends 2010 as the si@@ ck man of South Asi@@ a.
The political system also remains uns@@ ett@@ led.
Despite pas@@ sage in Ju@@ ly of the 18@@ th am@@ end@@ ment to the Pakistan@@ i constitu@@ tion, which restor@@ ed it to the form in which it was pro@@ mul@@ g@@ ated in 197@@ 3, political and execu@@ tive authority remains in the hands of President Asi@@ f Al@@ i Z@@ ar@@ dar@@ i@@ .
The changes are supposed to make the execu@@ tive bran@@ ch accoun@@ table to the elected parliament@@ , exp@@ and the prime minist@@ er@@ ’s author@@ ity, de@@ vol@@ ve more power to the pro@@ vinc@@ es, and ensure independence to the judi@@ ci@@ ary.
In late 2009, the president also appro@@ ved the se@@ v@@ enth National Fin@@ ance Commission@@ , which will alloc@@ ate to the pro@@ vin@@ ces a larger share of the revenu@@ es collec@@ ted by the central government.
But a significant trans@@ fer of power from the presiden@@ cy to parliament@@ , or from the central to pro@@ vin@@ cial government@@ s, has yet to be brought ab@@ out.
Wor@@ se ye@@ t, the military remains outside civilian contro@@ l.
General A@@ sh@@ fa@@ q Per@@ ve@@ z K@@ ay@@ ani@@ ’s term in offic@@ e, which was set to exp@@ ire in Novem@@ ber, was exten@@ ded by three years.
Th@@ us em@@ power@@ ed, the general has been able to ex@@ ert his influence over foreign policy, in particular in defin@@ ing the country’s relations with the US, India, and Afghanist@@ an.
Even though the US offered $@@ 2 billion of assistance to the military to be dis@@ bur@@ sed over a period of 3@@ -@@ 5 years, K@@ ay@@ an@@ i has resist@@ ed American pressure to move against the Tali@@ ban@@ ’s sanc@@ tu@@ ary in North W@@ azi@@ ri@@ st@@ an, used to stage oper@@ ations against US and NATO troops in southern and e@@ ast@@ ern Afghanist@@ an.
So, is a further increase in violence by various extrem@@ ist groups lik@@ el@@ y?
Will the economy collapse if the IMF with@@ dra@@ ws its sup@@ port@@ ?
Will the US increase its pressure by interven@@ ing milit@@ arily if Pakistan continues to har@@ b@@ or Taliban figh@@ ters oper@@ ating from the tri@@ b@@ al are@@ as@@ ?
Will the military sub@@ ver@@ t the constitutional changes aimed at reform@@ ing the political system@@ ?
Despite all the gri@@ m news and au@@ gu@@ ri@@ es, there is some hop@@ e, owing to the increased political mobili@@ zation of Pakistan@@ ’s middle cl@@ ass@@ es, whose members have finally be@@ gu@@ n to question those es@@ po@@ using extre@@ mis@@ m.
The judi@@ ci@@ ary is also more ac@@ tive, and is attemp@@ ting to force the execu@@ tive to remain within the bo@@ und@@ s of the constitu@@ tion.
Moreover, a trade agreement with Afghanistan that allow@@ s Afgh@@ an goods to c@@ ross Pakistan en rou@@ te to India may be one step towards an impro@@ vement of economic relations with that large and rapidly growing neighbor@@ .
Indeed, an able economic te@@ am that has been inst@@ all@@ ed in the government seems – at long last – to be addres@@ sing some of the econom@@ y’s deep structural f@@ law@@ s.
As India in the 1990@@ ’s and Brazi@@ l in the early 200@@ 0’s show@@ ed, economies in deep dist@@ ress can reco@@ ver quickly once the right policies are implement@@ ed.
It could also happen in Pakistan, which would help to solve o@@ ther, seem@@ ingly in@@ trac@@ table problems.
So all hope is not lost in Pakist@@ an.
On the contrary, 2011 may well prove to be a better year for a b@@ at@@ tered economy and a political system under st@@ res@@ s.
W@@ AS@@ HI@@ NG@@ T@@ ON@@ , D@@ C – Egyp@@ t’s revolution top@@ pl@@ ed a dict@@ ator in Febru@@ ary, but the country’s future as a stab@@ le, func@@ tioning democracy remains uncertain@@ .
The West is, of course, limited in its ability to shap@@ e the transition process.
N@@ on@@ eth@@ eless, the potential for construc@@ tive influence remains consider@@ able, and it should be respon@@ sive to those in Egypt who favor liberal ide@@ as, democratic institutions, and broad distribution of the benefits of economic development.
The up@@ coming parliamentary elections are but an early stage in a long (@@ perhaps decad@@ es@@ -@@ lon@@ g@@ ) struggle to defin@@ e the new Egyp@@ t.
Will Egypt gra@@ vit@@ ate toward Islamic the@@ oc@@ ra@@ cy or adop@@ t a sec@@ ular government that respec@@ ts min@@ ority righ@@ ts@@ ?
Wh@@ ich economic policies – st@@ ati@@ st, liber@@ al, or some combin@@ ation of the two – will best ensure social justice and broad distribution of prosper@@ it@@ y?
C@@ an civilian control of the military be establish@@ ed@@ ?
Will the regional security structure form@@ ed around the United States, Egyp@@ t, and Israel survi@@ ve@@ ?
The November elections will not resol@@ ve these fundamental ques@@ tions, and whether a work@@ able constitutional framework will develop is uncertain@@ .
A parliamentary system of government will likely emer@@ ge, including a prime minister and a c@@ ab@@ ine@@ t, with the strong possibility that the presiden@@ cy will be politically over@@ sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ ed, particularly if the presidential election is del@@ ay@@ ed.
The central unk@@ now@@ n is the com@@ position of the ruling co@@ ali@@ tion.
It appears unlikely that a single party will emer@@ ge from the election with enough parliamentary se@@ ats to go@@ ver@@ n on its ow@@ n.
So a coalition government will be necess@@ ary.
The political ar@@ m of the Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood (the Fre@@ ed@@ om and Justi@@ ce Par@@ ty@@ ) currently is the best@@ -@@ organiz@@ ed par@@ ty, and may be in the stron@@ gest position to form a majority co@@ ali@@ tion, including Sal@@ af@@ ist el@@ em@@ ents.
By contrast, sec@@ ular liberal parties have yet to develop effective organizations or project comp@@ elling vi@@ sions for the future.
Although senti@@ ment favor@@ ing a sec@@ ular state is consider@@ able, a coalition that can serve as an alternative or counter@@ wei@@ ght to the Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood will be difficult to ass@@ em@@ ble.
In the near ter@@ m, the most likely counter@@ wei@@ ght could be a liberal coalition with a heav@@ y comp@@ on@@ ent of former members of de@@ posed President H@@ os@@ ni Mubarak@@ ’s National Democratic Party (@@ N@@ DP@@ ) – that is, those who have not been dis@@ credi@@ ted by their associ@@ ation with Mubarak@@ .
E@@ lec@@ tion rules favor those who were organiz@@ ed before the revolu@@ tion.
A@@ p@@ pro@@ xim@@ ately one-@@ third of the new parli@@ ament will com@@ pri@@ se “@@ non-@@ party li@@ st@@ ” candid@@ at@@ es.
Est@@ abli@@ shed net@@ works based on fam@@ il@@ y, local loy@@ al@@ ties, and tri@@ b@@ al aff@@ ili@@ ations will be key determin@@ ants in vo@@ t@@ ing@@ .@@ &#160;@@ These circum@@ stan@@ ces may favor “@@ non-@@ party li@@ st@@ ” candidates associated with the Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood and the former N@@ DP@@ , particularly in rural Egyp@@ t.
Po@@ st-@@ election shif@@ ts in the com@@ position of co@@ ali@@ tions could complic@@ ate the situ@@ ation, making governance even more difficul@@ t.
Po@@ wer@@ -@@ shar@@ ing among coalition partn@@ ers will be an in@@ tric@@ ate affair@@ , including behin@@ d-@@ th@@ e-@@ sc@@ en@@ es de@@ als with the milit@@ ary, which will insi@@ st on measures to saf@@ eg@@ u@@ ard its interest@@ s.
The political at@@ mosph@@ ere in Egypt remains volati@@ le.
Ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ ations of economic impro@@ vement are extrem@@ ely high@@ .
The ini@@ tial elected government may pay an early political price for fail@@ u@@ re.
The star@@ ting point for the West in trying to assi@@ st Egyp@@ t’s transition must be recogni@@ tion that pati@@ ent, long-term en@@ gagement will be require@@ d.
The effec@@ tiveness of this en@@ gagement will depend pri@@ mar@@ ily on the persu@@ asi@@ ven@@ ess of the West@@ ’s policy pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions, rather than on the volum@@ e of financial assi@@ st@@ ance.
G-@@ 8 countries have already p@@ led@@ ged support to post-@@ Mubarak Egyp@@ t, including economic ai@@ d, debt reli@@ ef@@ , and lo@@ an guarante@@ es.
These steps are import@@ ant, though deli@@ very will be pro@@ lon@@ ged and the likely impact mo@@ des@@ t, at least in the ne@@ ar-@@ ter@@ m.
Egypt has already decl@@ ined support from the International Monetary Fund@@ .
But, ap@@ art from an IMF@@ -@@ backed reform progra@@ m, if the Egypti@@ an government’s policy framework is righ@@ t, resources will f@@ low from the private sector@@ , including foreign investment suppor@@ tive of job creation and economic development.
This is the message that Egypt needs to gra@@ s@@ p and emb@@ rac@@ e.
G-@@ 8 governments should urg@@ ently and repe@@ at@@ edly under@@ take qu@@ ie@@ t, structu@@ re@@ d, and consist@@ ent communic@@ ations with Egypti@@ an counter@@ parts about the economic reforms needed to bring about prosper@@ ity.
It is far too early to jud@@ ge the streng@@ th of internal forces promoting liberal economic policies.
The need for economic growth could in@@ tr@@ insi@@ cally push policymakers toward market@@ -@@ ori@@ ented economic policies (@@ sensi@@ tive to consider@@ ations of “@@ social j@@ us@@ tic@@ e@@ ”@@ ) and an open investment environ@@ ment.
Po@@ wer@@ ful forces within the Egypti@@ an business community are sil@@ ent at the mom@@ ent, but in time will reas@@ ser@@ t themsel@@ ves.
Many business interests with job@@ -@@ creating capacity want the continu@@ ation of market@@ -@@ ori@@ ented reforms be@@ gu@@ n a decade ago (@@ which produced im@@ pres@@ sive growth rat@@ es@@ ), but support bro@@ ad@@ ening prosperity and roo@@ ting out corrup@@ tion.
Moreover, an independent media might tend to rein@@ force pro-@@ market and democratic senti@@ ment.
Indeed, Western governments should continue to use their chan@@ n@@ els to the Egypti@@ an military and future civil leadership to encourage them to up@@ hold the rule of law, to act with res@@ tra@@ in@@ t, and to respect free ex@@ pres@@ sion.
Region@@ al security arran@@ gements will also require car@@ eful main@@ ten@@ ance.
Finally, countries suppor@@ tive of a democratic Egypt should focus on encoura@@ ging the institutional and social under@@ p@@ inn@@ ings of democratic process and market reform@@ .
This depends on the development of a ro@@ b@@ ust civil societ@@ y, toler@@ ant of open deb@@ ate, and health@@ y liberal political parti@@ es, as well as active particip@@ ation by women and an independent medi@@ a.
W@@ inn@@ ing broad public support will take time.
Priv@@ ate non-@@ prof@@ it organizations and private enterpri@@ se, rather than governments direc@@ t@@ ly, are best equi@@ pped to provide this type of tra@@ ining and exper@@ ti@@ se for leadership development and capacity buil@@ d@@ ing.
The job of democratic governments is to provide the resources that can make deli@@ very of this aid possible.
CAMBRIDG@@ E@@ : In his first international ou@@ ting America’s new Treasury Secretary Paul O@@ ’@@ N@@ ei@@ ll go@@ t tri@@ pped up – by t@@ elling the tru@@ th.
During the Clinton Administ@@ ration, Treasury Secretary Robert R@@ ub@@ in and then L@@ aw@@ ren@@ ce Sum@@ m@@ ers st@@ ated that America had a “@@ strong dollar policy@@ .”
O@@ ’@@ N@@ ei@@ ll repor@@ tedly said that “@@ We are not pursu@@ ing@@ ..@@ . a policy of a strong dollar@@ .” Im@@ medi@@ ately attack@@ ed for re@@ vers@@ ing a long-@@ held policy, he quickly re@@ treat@@ ed.
To@@ o b@@ ad, because his com@@ ment made a lot more sense than his pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ or@@ s’ stat@@ em@@ ents.
The truth is, America really do@@ es@@ n’t have an exchange rate policy.
When Al@@ an Greensp@@ an pon@@ ders the next move in US interest rates, little attention is paid to the dollar@@ ’s exchange rate vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ v@@ is the Euro@@ , Y@@ en, or other curren@@ cies.
American monetary policy decisions depend on the streng@@ th or weak@@ ness of the domestic economy and on US infl@@ ation.
If the economy is slow@@ ing, if there is exc@@ ess capac@@ ity, and if inflation is low@@ , interest rates are reduc@@ ed@@ ; if the economy is stron@@ g, if exc@@ ess capacity is limit@@ ed, and if inflation@@ ary pressu@@ res are grow@@ ing, interest rates are rais@@ ed.
Nor does the Fed interven@@ e directly in foreign exchange markets exc@@ ept in extra@@ ordinary circum@@ st@@ anc@@ es.
In only one sense does the US actually pursue a “@@ strong dollar@@ ” policy@@ : the Federal Reser@@ ve@@ ’s monetary policy is designed to keep inflation low@@ .
The dollar is kept “@@ stron@@ g@@ ” in terms of its purchas@@ ing power over US goods and servic@@ es.
But this is not what markets believed the “@@ strong dollar@@ ”@@ policy mean@@ t. They believed that the strong dollar policy refer@@ red to exchange rates.
In this sen@@ se, the “@@ strong dollar@@ ” policy would mean that America has a “@@ weak Euro@@ ” policy or a “@@ weak Y@@ en@@ ” policy.
It has no such th@@ ing.
So why did succ@@ essive Treasury Sec@@ ret@@ aries say that the US has a strong dollar policy@@ ?
Par@@ t of the answer is that support for a strong dollar is an easy s@@ lo@@ gan@@ ; it so@@ und@@ s pat@@ rio@@ tic@@ .
Moreover, it would have been viewed as hosti@@ le if Sec@@ ret@@ aries R@@ ub@@ in and Sum@@ m@@ ers insi@@ sted that they believed in a “@@ weak Euro@@ ”@@ , even if they were implic@@ it@@ ly sa@@ ying th@@ at.
A tru@@ er stat@@ ement for R@@ ub@@ in and Sum@@ m@@ ers would have been to say that America actually has no exchange rate policy, the answer that O@@ ’@@ N@@ ei@@ ll tried to gi@@ ve.
Another reason ex@@ ists for their stat@@ em@@ ents. Some US officials believe that the “@@ strong dollar@@ ” stat@@ ements helped stabili@@ ze foreign exchange markets, even if American monetary policy was not direc@@ ted at the dollar@@ ’s streng@@ th vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ v@@ is the Euro or Y@@ en.
Some believe that, without such stat@@ em@@ ents, the dollar would pl@@ un@@ ge relative to the Euro and Y@@ en.
After all, if the US@@ Treasury Secretary does not support the doll@@ ar, what would su@@ sta@@ in its valu@@ e?
According to this interpre@@ t@@ ation, market particip@@ ants would begin to predic@@ t the decline of the doll@@ ar.
They would sell dollars in anti@@ cip@@ ation of its decl@@ ine. Those currency s@@ ales would inde@@ ed lead to a collapse of the curren@@ cy.
The decline in the dollar@@ ’s value would be a self-@@ ful@@ fill@@ ing pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y.
Sel@@ f-@@ ful@@ fill@@ ing s@@ w@@ ings in a currency do seem to oper@@ ate.
Stat@@ ements about a “@@ strong dollar@@ ” policy could support the value of the dollar over a short period of time, even years.
But event@@ u@@ ally, fundamental economic strength@@ s and weak@@ n@@ esses have more effect on the exchange rate than self-@@ ful@@ fill@@ ing pro@@ ph@@ eci@@ es.
I@@ f, as now seems to be the case, America’s economy is weak@@ ening while Europe’s economies remain stron@@ g, the dollar will weak@@ en vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ v@@ is the Euro whether or not the US Treasury Secretary promo@@ tes the doll@@ ar.
A weak@@ er dollar vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ v@@ is the Euro will help su@@ sta@@ in demand in the US as the economy slow@@ s.
Similarly, the Y@@ en will tend to weak@@ en vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ v@@ is both the dollar and the Euro because of Japan’s underlying weak@@ n@@ ess@@ es.
If stat@@ ements about a strong dollar policy had any effect at all, they probably helped promote America’s financial bub@@ ble during 199@@ 8@@ -@@ 200@@ 0.
Invest@@ ors in the US and the rest of the world believed for this short period that investments in the US guarante@@ ed rich@@ es; this contribut@@ ed to the boom and b@@ ust in US technology stock@@ s.
The n@@ ai@@ ve view that the dollar would always remain strong (and would strengthen even mor@@ e) vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ v@@ is the Euro added fuel to the capital inf@@ low@@ s into Americ@@ a.
Now that the bub@@ ble is bur@@ st@@ ing, US stock markets are down and the dollar is weak@@ ening relative to the Euro@@ .
The earlier exc@@ esses could bring on a recession in the US this year.
So what should America’s exchange rate policy be@@ ?
Bas@@ ing American monetary policy on domestic business condi@@ tions, rather than on the exchange rat@@ e, is correc@@ t.
S@@ m@@ all economies clo@@ sely integ@@ rated with their trading partn@@ ers might set exchange rate targe@@ ts, or fi@@ x their exchange rate to the curren@@ cies of their trading partn@@ ers, but large and relatively clos@@ ed economies like the US, EU, and Japan, do better to focus on their own business condi@@ tions, let@@ ting markets determin@@ e the exchange rat@@ e.
The dollar should be left to rise or fall vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ v@@ is the Euro and Y@@ en dep@@ ending on the underlying strength@@ s and weak@@ n@@ esses of the three economic are@@ as.
In today’s con@@ tex@@ t, market forces will probably lead to a further weak@@ ening of the dollar vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ v@@ is the Euro@@ , and a further weak@@ ening of the Y@@ en vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ v@@ is both the dollar and the Euro@@ .
Secretary O@@ ’@@ N@@ ei@@ ll therefore had it righ@@ t, even if his wor@@ ds were cl@@ ums@@ y.
America should have neither a strong dollar nor a weak dollar policy, only a policy of sensi@@ ble domestic monetary policies, and a belief that foreign exchange markets should determin@@ e exchange rates.
B@@ ER@@ L@@ I@@ N -@@ - Turkey’s “@@ no@@ ” last month (@@ a vote c@@ ast together with Braz@@ il@@ ) to the new sanctions against Iran appro@@ ved in the United Nations Security Council dramati@@ cally reve@@ als the full extent of the country’s est@@ ran@@ gement from the Wes@@ t.
Ar@@ e w@@ e, as many com@@ ment@@ ators have argu@@ ed, witn@@ essing the consequences of the so-called “@@ ne@@ o-@@ O@@ tt@@ om@@ an@@ ” foreign policy of Turkey’s Justi@@ ce and Development Party (@@ AK@@ P@@ ) government, which is sup@@ pos@@ edly aimed at s@@ wit@@ ching camp@@ s and retur@@ ning to the country’s ori@@ ent@@ al Islamic roo@@ ts@@ ?

I believe that these fear@@ s are ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated, even mis@@ plac@@ ed.
And should things work out that way, this would be due more to a self-@@ ful@@ fill@@ ing pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y on the West@@ ’s part than to Turkey’s policies.
In fact, Turkey’s foreign policy, which seek@@ s to resol@@ ve existing conflic@@ ts with and within neighbor@@ ing states, and active Turkish invol@@ vement ther@@ e, is anything but in conflict with Western interest@@ s. Qu@@ ite the contr@@ ary.
But the West (and Europe in particul@@ ar@@ ) will finally have to take Turkey seri@@ ously as a partn@@ er – and stop view@@ ing it as a Western cli@@ ent state.
Turkey is and should be a member of the G-@@ 20@@ , bec@@ aus@@ e, with its yo@@ ung, rapidly growing population it will become a very strong state economic@@ ally in the twent@@ y-@@ first century.
Even today, the ima@@ ge of Turkey as the “@@ si@@ ck man of Europe@@ ” is no longer ac@@ cur@@ ate.
Wh@@ en, after the UN deci@@ sion, United States Secretary of Def@@ ense Robert G@@ ates har@@ sh@@ ly cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed Europeans for having contribut@@ ed to this est@@ ran@@ gement by their behavior towards Turke@@ y, his un@@ diplomatic f@@ rank@@ ness caused quite a sti@@ r in Par@@ is and Ber@@ lin@@ .
But G@@ ates had hit the n@@ ail on the head@@ .
E@@ ver since the change in government from J@@ acqu@@ es Chi@@ ra@@ c to Nicolas Sarkozy in France and from Ger@@ hard Sch@@ rö@@ der to Angel@@ a Merkel in Germany, Turkey has been st@@ r@@ ung along and put off by the European Union. Indeed, in the case of C@@ yp@@ rus@@ , the EU w@@ as@@ n’t even above break@@ ing previous commit@@ ments vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ v@@ is Turkey and unilater@@ ally changing jo@@ in@@ tl@@ y-@@ agreed rul@@ es.
And, while the Europeans have form@@ ally kept to their decision to begin acc@@ ession negotiations with Turke@@ y, they have done little to adv@@ ance the cau@@ se.

Only now, when the disa@@ ster in Turk@@ ish@@ -@@ European relations is becoming appar@@ ent, is the EU sud@@ den@@ ly willing to open a new ch@@ ap@@ ter in the negotiations (@@ wh@@ ich, inci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally, clearly pro@@ ves that the de@@ ad@@ lo@@ ck was politically mo@@ tiv@@ at@@ ed@@ ).
It can@@ ’t be said often enough@@ : Turkey is situ@@ ated in a highly sensi@@ tive geo@@ political loc@@ ation, particularly where Europe’s security is concern@@ ed.
The e@@ ast@@ ern Medi@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an, the A@@ e@@ ge@@ an, the wes@@ tern Bal@@ kan@@ s, the C@@ as@@ pi@@ an region and the southern C@@ au@@ cas@@ us, Central Asia, and the Middle East are all areas where the West will achieve nothing or very little without Turkey’s suppor@@ t. And this is true in terms not only of security policy, but also of energy policy if you@@ ’@@ re looking for altern@@ atives to Europe’s growing reli@@ ance on Russian energy supp@@ li@@ es.

The Wes@@ t, and Europe in particul@@ ar, really can@@ ’t afford to alien@@ ate Turke@@ y, consider@@ ing their interest@@ s, but objec@@ tively it is exac@@ tly this kind of est@@ ran@@ gement that follow@@ s from European policy towards Turkey in the last few years.
Europe’s security in the twent@@ y-@@ first century will be determined to a significant degree in its neighbor@@ hood in the sou@@ the@@ ast – exac@@ tly where Turkey is crucial for Europe’s security interests now and, increas@@ ing@@ ly, in the future.
But, rather than bin@@ ding Turkey as clo@@ sely as possible to Europe and the Wes@@ t, European policy is dri@@ ving Turkey into the arms of Russia and Iran@@ .
This kind of policy is ir@@ on@@ ic@@ , ab@@ sur@@ d, and short@@ si@@ gh@@ ted all at on@@ ce.
For cent@@ uri@@ es, Russia, Iran, and Turkey have been regional ri@@ val@@ s, never alli@@ es.
Europe’s political blin@@ d@@ n@@ ess, however, seems to over@@ ri@@ de this fac@@ t.
Of course, Turke@@ y, too, is great@@ ly dependent on integration with the Wes@@ t.
Sh@@ ould it lose this, it would drasti@@ cally weak@@ en its own position vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ v@@ is its potential regional partn@@ ers (and ri@@ val@@ s@@ ), despite its ide@@ al geo@@ political loc@@ ation.
Turkey’s “@@ no@@ ” to new sanctions against Iran in all lik@@ eli@@ hood will prove to be a significant er@@ ror@@ , unless Prime Minister Rec@@ ep Ta@@ y@@ y@@ i@@ p Erdo@@ ğ@@ an can deli@@ ver a real tur@@ n@@ around in Iran’s nuclear policy.
Th@@ is, however, is highly un@@ lik@@ el@@ y.
Moreover, with the confron@@ tation between Israel and Turkey strength@@ ening radical forces in the Middle East, what is European diplom@@ acy (@@ both in B@@ rus@@ sel@@ s and in European capit@@ al@@ s) wa@@ iting for@@ ? The Wes@@ t, as well as Israel and Turkey themsel@@ ves, most certainly cannot afford a permanent rup@@ ture between the two states, unless the desi@@ red outcome is for the region to continue on its path to la@@ sting destabili@@ z@@ ation.
It is more than time for Europe to ac@@ t.
Wor@@ se still@@ , while Europe’s li@@ st@@ less@@ ness is visi@@ ble first and for@@ emo@@ st in the case of Turkey and the Middle East, this lam@@ ent@@ able state of affair@@ s is not limited to that region. The same app@@ lies to the southern C@@ au@@ cas@@ us and Central Asia, where Europe, with the appro@@ val of the smaller supp@@ lier countries ther@@ e, should firm@@ ly pursue its energy interests and asser@@ t itself vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ v@@ is Russia, as well as to Ukra@@ ine, where Europe should also become seri@@ ously invol@@ v@@ ed.
Many new develop@@ ments have been set in mo@@ tion in that entire region by the global economic crisis, and a new play@@ er, China (@@ a long-term plann@@ er@@ ), has ent@@ ered the geo@@ political sta@@ ge.
Europe risks running out of time, even in its own neighbor@@ ho@@ od, because active European foreign policy and a strong commitment on the part of the EU are sor@@ ely mis@@ sed in all these countries.
Or@@ , as Mik@@ ha@@ il Gor@@ b@@ ach@@ ev@@ , that great Russian stat@@ es@@ man of the last decades of the twenti@@ eth century, put it@@ : “@@ Li@@ fe has a way of pun@@ ish@@ ing those who come too lat@@ e.”
S@@ I@@ NG@@ A@@ P@@ OR@@ E – Lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y-@@ br@@ and compani@@ es’ stock prices pl@@ ung@@ ed in Jul@@ y, after their financial results dis@@ appoin@@ ted invest@@ ors, owing largely to s@@ lower s@@ ales in emerging markets, especially in China.
Meanwhile, news repor@@ ts indic@@ ate that high-@@ end sh@@ opp@@ ing m@@ all@@ s in India and China are increasingly emp@@ ty.
What is going on@@ ?
Many analy@@ sts had expected emerging markets to generate exp@@ on@@ ential growth over the next deca@@ de.
But now there is talk of how the global crisis is slow@@ ing down these economies and kill@@ ing off dis@@ cre@@ tionary spend@@ ing.
But a slow@@ down in China’s economic growth cannot really be blam@@ ed for s@@ lower s@@ ales of lu@@ x@@ ury goods or emp@@ ty m@@ all@@ s.
The annual growth rate of China’s $@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 trillion economy dec@@ eler@@ ated to 7@@ .@@ 6% in the second quar@@ ter, from 8@@ .@@ 1% in Janu@@ ar@@ y-@@ Mar@@ ch – hardly a cause for pan@@ ic@@ .
Moreover, two-@@ thir@@ ds of the decline is at@@ tri@@ but@@ able to s@@ lower investment rather than s@@ lower consump@@ tion.
For all of China’s long-term structural problem@@ s, it is not exac@@ tly s@@ li@@ pp@@ ing into recession@@ .
The real problem is that many analy@@ sts had ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated the size of the lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y-@@ goods se@@ g@@ ment in emerging markets.
China is by far the largest emerg@@ ing-@@ market economy, with 1.@@ 6 million households that can be called “@@ rich@@ ” (@@ defin@@ ed as having annual dis@@ pos@@ able income of more than $@@ 1@@ 50@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ ).
But this is still smaller than Japan’s 4@@ .@@ 6 million and a fra@@ c@@ tion of the 19@@ .@@ 2 million rich households in the United Stat@@ es.
The number of rich households amoun@@ ts to bar@@ ely 0.@@ 7 million in India and one million in Braz@@ il.
The point is that developed countries still domin@@ ate the income bra@@ ck@@ et that can afford lu@@ x@@ ury good@@ s.
The explo@@ sive growth rec@@ or@@ ded by this se@@ g@@ ment in emerging markets in recent years reflec@@ ted ent@@ ry into pre@@ viously un@@ t@@ app@@ ed markets, with the sub@@ sequ@@ ent slow@@ down resulting from sat@@ u@@ ra@@ tion.
The number of high-@@ income households is still grow@@ ing, but not enough to justi@@ fy the 3@@ 0-@@ 40% com@@ po@@ unded growth rates expected by som@@ e.
This does not mean that growth opportunities in emerging markets have dis@@ appear@@ ed, but expect@@ ations do need to be rec@@ ali@@ b@@ rat@@ ed.
Despite the economic boom of the last deca@@ de, China still has 16@@ 4 million households that can be called “@@ poor@@ ” (@@ with annual dis@@ pos@@ able income of less than $@@ 5@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ ) and another 17@@ 2 million that are “@@ asp@@ ir@@ ant@@ ” (@@ between $@@ 5@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ $@@ 15@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ ).
Similarly, India has 10@@ 4 million poor households and 10@@ 7 million asp@@ ir@@ ant househ@@ old@@ s.
The real story for the next two decades will be these countries’ shift to m@@ idd@@ le-@@ class stat@@ us.
Although other emerging regions will under@@ go a similar shi@@ ft, Asia will domin@@ ate this transform@@ ation.
A study by the econom@@ ist H@@ om@@ i K@@ har@@ as of the Bro@@ ok@@ ings Institu@@ tion gi@@ ves us a sense of the scale of this change.
He estim@@ ates that 18@@ % of the world’s middle class li@@ ved in North America in 2009, while another 3@@ 6% li@@ ved in Europe.
Asi@@ a’s share was 2@@ 8% (@@ after including Japan@@ ).
But K@@ har@@ as@@ ’s projec@@ tions suggest that Asia will account for two-@@ thir@@ ds of the world’s middle class by 20@@ 3@@ 0.
In other words, Asia will disp@@ l@@ ace not just the Wes@@ t, but even other emerging region@@ s.
This is the real business opport@@ un@@ ity.
Of course, the rise of Asi@@ a’s middle class is not the only change we should expec@@ t.
We are in the middle of a social and demograph@@ ic shift that will both destro@@ y and create consumer markets. The aging of developed markets is well know@@ n, but the latest data show that emerging markets are aging at an even faster p@@ ac@@ e.
China’s medi@@ an age is today 3@@ 4@@ .@@ 5 years, compared to 3@@ 6@@ .@@ 9 years for the US.
However, the average Chinese will be 4@@ 2.@@ 5 years old by 20@@ 3@@ 0, compared to 3@@ 9@@ .@@ 1 for the average Americ@@ an.
The medi@@ an Russian will be even ol@@ der, at 4@@ 3.@@ 3 years.
The impact of aging is already being fel@@ t in these countries’ education system@@ s.
The number of students en@@ ro@@ ll@@ ed in primary school@@ s in China has fallen by 18@@ % since 199@@ 0, and by an ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing 3@@ 3% in South Kore@@ a.
At the other end of the demograph@@ ic sc@@ al@@ e, the share of the aged is growing explo@@ si@@ vel@@ y.
Meanwhile, the nature of the basic consum@@ ing un@@ it – the household – is also changing rapid@@ ly.
In most developed countries, the traditional nuclear family is in severe decline and is being re@@ placed by sing@@ le-@@ individual househ@@ old@@ s.
In Germany, for example, 3@@ 9@@ % of households consi@@ st of just one person@@ .
C@@ ou@@ ples with children now account for bar@@ ely 19@@ % and 2@@ 2% of households in the United King@@ dom and the US, respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y.
Nevertheless, it is not all about consumer atom@@ iz@@ ation.
We are si@@ mul@@ tane@@ ously witn@@ essing the re-@@ emer@@ gence of the multi@@ gener@@ ational exten@@ ded fam@@ il@@ y, with as many as 2@@ 2% of American ad@@ ul@@ ts in the 25@@ -@@ 3@@ 5 age group living with par@@ ents or relati@@ ves.
By contrast, the exten@@ ded family is giving way in India to nuclear famili@@ es, which now account for 6@@ 4% of househ@@ old@@ s.
All of these changes will pro@@ found@@ ly aff@@ ect the future of consumer markets.
For example, we need to re@@ vis@@ e our mental ima@@ ge of the nuclear family from American sub@@ ur@@ bi@@ a to f@@ it the rapidly exp@@ anding cities of Indi@@ a.
By the same to@@ k@@ en, our mental ima@@ ge of the multi@@ gener@@ ational exten@@ ded family needs to include those in the Wes@@ t.
An aging but increasingly m@@ idd@@ le-@@ class Asia will be at the core of this new consumer land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e.
Cor@@ ruption undermin@@ es the quality of life for people around the world, not only in poor countries.
The US currently is witn@@ essing several corruption sc@@ and@@ als.
Even America’s Federal E@@ mer@@ gency Man@@ a@@ gement Agen@@ cy, responsible for providing re@@ lief after natural disa@@ st@@ ers and man@@ -@@ made c@@ atastroph@@ es, was in the hands of in@@ ept political c@@ ron@@ ies rather than profession@@ als.
When hur@@ ri@@ can@@ e Kat@@ rin@@ a stru@@ ck America’s Gul@@ f Co@@ ast@@ , that in@@ comp@@ et@@ ence pro@@ ved f@@ at@@ al.
All societies require an effective government that can provide vital and ir@@ re@@ plac@@ e@@ able public services and infrastructu@@ re.
Thus, governments are invest@@ ed with uni@@ que power@@ s, especially the powers of polic@@ ing and judi@@ cial contro@@ l.
But these powers are also rea@@ di@@ ly ab@@ us@@ ed.
H@@ ow, then, to ensure that governments are law@@ -@@ ab@@ iding as well as stron@@ g@@ ?
The best answer@@ , both in theory and practic@@ e, is to find ways to hold governments accoun@@ table to the people that they serv@@ e.
E@@ lec@@ tions are ob@@ viously one metho@@ d, though campaign financing can be a source of corrup@@ tion.
Politi@@ ci@@ ans around the world trade favor@@ s for cas@@ h needed to win elec@@ tions, and they often use that cas@@ h to buy the vo@@ tes of des@@ per@@ ately poor people.
C@@ le@@ ar electoral rules and proc@@ edu@@ res can help ensure transpar@@ enc@@ y, but account@@ ability also comes from the broad society in between elec@@ tions.
Priv@@ ately owned newspap@@ ers, independent radi@@ o and tel@@ evi@@ sion net@@ work@@ s, trade uni@@ on@@ s, ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ es, profession@@ al socie@@ ties, and other groups within civil society provide a bul@@ war@@ k against des@@ po@@ ti@@ sm@@ .
In the poorest countries, where illi@@ ter@@ acy is high@@ , des@@ per@@ ate people are subject to government manipul@@ ation, and there is a lack of independent control through the media and profession@@ al organiz@@ ations, governments face only weak control by society.
They tend to be the most des@@ po@@ tic and corrup@@ t, not because poor people care less about good governance – on the contrary, their very lives depend on it – but because they lack the means to keep their government discipl@@ ined and law ab@@ id@@ ing.
The result is a tra@@ p in which poverty causes bad governance and bad governance causes poverty – a two-@@ way spi@@ ral down@@ ward that can lead to such extreme de@@ priv@@ ation that the government, lack@@ ing compu@@ ters, tel@@ ep@@ hon@@ es, information system@@ s, and tra@@ ined civil serv@@ ant@@ s, cou@@ l@@ d@@ n’t func@@ tion hon@@ est@@ ly even if it wanted to@@ .
The end result can be collapse into a kind of an@@ arch@@ y, as in Liber@@ i@@ a, S@@ ier@@ ra Le@@ one, and Som@@ ali@@ a.
One measure of the quality of governance in over 1@@ 50 countries is provided by Transpar@@ ency Internation@@ al, an organiz@@ ation de@@ dic@@ ated to strength@@ ening civil society in the fight against government corrup@@ tion.
Transpar@@ ency International produ@@ ces an annual rank@@ ing of “@@ corruption perc@@ ep@@ tions@@ ,” meas@@ uring the public@@ ’s view of the extent of corruption in a country.
In the 2005 rank@@ ings, I@@ cel@@ and s@@ cor@@ ed as the least corrup@@ t country, with the S@@ c@@ and@@ in@@ avi@@ an countries, New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and, and Singap@@ or@@ e close behin@@ d.
The US rank@@ ed se@@ v@@ ent@@ e@@ enth from the top@@ , a no@@ t-@@ so-@@ gl@@ ori@@ ous position for the world’s leading power.
In gener@@ al, the poor@@ er the country, the lower the rank@@ ing@@ : ti@@ ed for last place are C@@ had and Bang@@ lad@@ es@@ h@@ .
A b@@ it of statisti@@ cal analysi@@ s reve@@ als further important pat@@ tern@@ s.
First, Sub@@ -S@@ ahar@@ an African countries are less corrup@@ t on average than countries at the same income level in other parts of the world.
For example, Bur@@ kin@@ a F@@ as@@ o, G@@ han@@ a, M@@ ali@@ , and R@@ wand@@ a ran@@ k much higher than Bang@@ lad@@ es@@ h@@ , Indonesi@@ a, Pakistan, and Vietnam@@ .
Yet the Asian countries’ economies have ten@@ ded to grow much faster over the past gener@@ ation.
Cor@@ ruption therefore cannot be the uni@@ que factor that hol@@ ds Africa back@@ .
Afric@@ a’s problems have more to do with d@@ rough@@ ts, mal@@ ari@@ a, AIDS@@ , and lack of infrastructu@@ re.
Po@@ or countries achieve lower levels of corruption when civil rights are protec@@ ted.
When people have the freedom to ass@@ em@@ ble, to spe@@ ak@@ , and to publi@@ sh their view@@ s, society benefits not only by increasing the range of ideas that are deb@@ ated, but also by ke@@ eping corruption in ch@@ eck@@ .
It is no surpri@@ se that corrup@@ t regimes ro@@ ut@@ in@@ ely cl@@ am@@ p down on the pres@@ s, trade uni@@ on@@ s, and on profession@@ al associ@@ ations.
In Africa, less corrup@@ t countries like G@@ han@@ a also have much better protection of civil liber@@ ties than more corrup@@ tion@@ -@@ pr@@ one countries like C@@ had and Eth@@ i@@ op@@ i@@ a, which are also even poor@@ er.
Finally, the data show that corruption is highest in oil and gas@@ -@@ produc@@ ing countries.
In gener@@ al, natural resources like o@@ il, g@@ as, di@@ am@@ ond@@ s, and other preci@@ ous min@@ er@@ als bre@@ ed corrup@@ tion, because governments can live off of their export ear@@ n@@ ings without having to “@@ com@@ promis@@ e” with their own socie@@ ties.
The natural resources are therefore not only a target of corruption but also an instru@@ ment of holding power.
Many foreign compani@@ es, in@@ tent on c@@ ash@@ ing in, fuel the pa@@ th@@ ology of corrup@@ t regimes by p@@ ed@@ d@@ ling in bri@@ b@@ es and political protec@@ tion.
The implic@@ ations for action are cle@@ ar. By strength@@ ening civil society – through legal rights and long-term economic development – and in@@ stit@@ ut@@ ing clear rules to ensure account@@ abilit@@ y, political des@@ po@@ ti@@ sm and corruption will be brought under contro@@ l.
We should be un@@ com@@ promis@@ ing, there@@ for@@ e, in our defense of civil liber@@ ties.
The rich world should offer im@@ pover@@ ished regions like sub@@ -S@@ ahar@@ an Africa more economic support to break out of pover@@ ty.
Of course, aid should be direc@@ ted to specific needs – for example, mal@@ aria contro@@ l, food produc@@ tion, safe drin@@ king wat@@ er, and san@@ it@@ ation – whose ful@@ fill@@ ment can be measu@@ red and monit@@ or@@ ed to res@@ ist corrup@@ tion.
By raising living standard@@ s, we would also be em@@ power@@ ing both civil society and im@@ pover@@ ished governments to def@@ end the rule of law@@ .
W@@ AS@@ HI@@ NG@@ T@@ ON@@ , D@@ C – The world is on the br@@ in@@ k of a n@@ ast@@ y confron@@ tation over exchange rates – now sp@@ ill@@ ing over to aff@@ ect trade policy (@@ America’s f@@ li@@ r@@ tation with protection@@ ism@@ ), attitu@@ des towards capital flows (@@ new restric@@ tions in Braz@@ il, Thail@@ and, and South Kore@@ a@@ ), and public support for economic globalization (@@ rising anti-@@ for@@ eig@@ ner senti@@ ment almost every@@ wher@@ e@@ ).
Wh@@ o is to blam@@ e for this situation getting so out of contro@@ l, and what is likely to happen ne@@ x@@ t?
The issue is usually fra@@ m@@ ed in terms of whether some countries are “@@ che@@ at@@ ing@@ ” by holding their exchange rates at an under@@ valu@@ ed rat@@ e, thus boo@@ sting their exports and limit@@ ing impor@@ ts relative to what would happen if their central banks flo@@ ated the local currency fre@@ el@@ y.
The main cul@@ pri@@ t in this conventional view is China, although the International Monetary Fund is a close sec@@ on@@ d.
But, considered more bro@@ ad@@ ly, the seri@@ ous@@ ness of today’s situation is pri@@ mar@@ ily due to Europe’s ref@@ us@@ al to reform global economic govern@@ ance, com@@ po@@ unded by years of political mis@@ management and self-@@ dec@@ ep@@ tion in the United Stat@@ es.
China certainly be@@ ars some responsi@@ bilit@@ y.
Par@@ tly by desig@@ n and partly by chan@@ ce, about a decade ago China found itself consist@@ ently accum@@ ul@@ ating large amoun@@ ts of foreign reserves by running a trade surplus and interven@@ ing to buy up the dollars that this gener@@ ated.
In most countries, such intervention would tend to push up infl@@ ation, because the central bank issues local currency in return for dollar@@ s.
But, because the Chinese financial system remains ti@@ gh@@ tly controlled and the op@@ tions for investors are very limit@@ ed, the us@@ ual inflation@@ ary consequences have not follow@@ ed.
This gi@@ ves China the unpreced@@ ented – for a large trading country – ability to accum@@ ul@@ ate foreign-@@ exchange reserves (@@ now approach@@ ing $@@ 3 trilli@@ on@@ ).
Its current-account surplus pe@@ ak@@ ed, before the financial crisis of 2008, at around 1@@ 1% of GDP.
And its export lob@@ by is fighting fi@@ erc@@ ely to keep the exchange rate roughly where it is relative to the doll@@ ar.
In princip@@ le, the IMF is supposed to press countries with under@@ valu@@ ed exchange rates to let their curren@@ cies appreci@@ ate.
The rhetor@@ ic from the Fund has been ambi@@ ti@@ ous, including at the recently conclu@@ ded annual meeting of its sharehol@@ ders – the world’s central banks and finance minist@@ ries – in Washingt@@ on.
But the reality is that the IMF has no power over China (or any other country with a current-account surpl@@ us@@ )@@ ; the final communi@@ qu@@ é last week@@ end was argu@@ ably the lam@@ est on rec@@ or@@ d.
Unfortunately, the IMF is gu@@ il@@ ty of more than h@@ ub@@ ri@@ s.
Its handl@@ ing of the Asian financial crisis in 199@@ 7-@@ 1998 sever@@ ely ant@@ ag@@ on@@ ized leading m@@ idd@@ le-@@ income emerg@@ ing-@@ market countries – and they still believe that the Fund does not have their interests at hear@@ t. Her@@ e, the West Europeans play a major ro@@ le, because they are great@@ ly over@@ repres@@ ented on the IMF@@ ’s execu@@ tive bo@@ ard and, despite all ent@@ re@@ ati@@ es, simply ref@@ use to consolid@@ ate their se@@ ats in order to give emerging markets significantly more influ@@ ence.
As a result, emerg@@ ing-@@ market countries, aim@@ ing to ensure that they avo@@ id@@ need@@ ing financial support from the IMF in the for@@ es@@ ee@@ able futu@@ re, are increasingly following China’s lead and trying to ensure that the@@ y, too, run current-account surpl@@ us@@ es.
In practic@@ e, this means fer@@ v@@ ent efforts to prevent their curren@@ cies from appreci@@ ating in valu@@ e.
But a great deal of responsibility for today’s global economic danger@@ s res@@ ts with the US, for three reason@@ s.
First, most emerging markets feel their curren@@ cies pressed to appreci@@ ate by growing capital inf@@ low@@ s.
Invest@@ ors in Brazi@@ l are being offered yiel@@ ds around 1@@ 1@@ %, while similar credit risks in the US are pa@@ ying no more than 2-@@ 3@@ %.
To man@@ y, this looks like a one-@@ way be@@ t.
Moreover, US rates are likely to sta@@ y low@@ , because America’s financial system ble@@ w itself up so comple@@ tel@@ y (@@ with help from European bank@@ s@@ ), and because low rates rema@@ in, for domestic reason@@ s, part of the post-@@ crisis policy mi@@ x@@ .
Second, the US has run record current-account deficits over the past deca@@ de, as the political eli@@ te – Republican and Democ@@ rats ali@@ ke – became increasingly com@@ for@@ table with over@@ consump@@ tion.
These deficits facilit@@ ate the surpl@@ uses that emerging markets such as China want to run – the world’s current accoun@@ ts ad@@ d up to zer@@ o, so if one large set of countries wants to run a surpl@@ us, some@@ one big needs to run a defic@@ it.
Le@@ ad@@ ing Bush administration officials used to talk of the US current-account deficit being a “@@ gi@@ ft@@ ” to the outside world.
But, hon@@ est@@ ly, the US has been over@@ consum@@ ing – living far beyond its means – for the past deca@@ de.
The idea that tax cuts would lead to productivity gains and would pay for themselves (and fi@@ x the bud@@ get@@ ) has pro@@ ved entirely ill@@ us@@ or@@ y.
Thir@@ d, the net f@@ low of capital is from emerging markets to the US – this is what it means to have current-account surpl@@ uses in emerging markets and a deficit in the US.
But the gro@@ s@@ s f@@ low of capital is from emerging market to emerging market, through big banks now implic@@ it@@ ly backed by the state in both the US and Europe.
From the per@@ spec@@ tive of international invest@@ ors, banks that are “@@ too big to fail@@ ” are the perf@@ ect places to par@@ k their reserves – as long as the sovereign in question remains solv@@ ent.
But what will these banks do with the fund@@ s?
When a similar issu@@ ed emerg@@ ed in the 197@@ 0’s – the so-called “@@ rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ing of oil surpl@@ us@@ es” – banks in Western financial cent@@ ers exten@@ ded loans to Latin America, communist Pol@@ and, and communist Rom@@ ani@@ a.
That was not a good ide@@ a, as it led to a massive (@@ for the ti@@ me@@ ) debt crisis in 198@@ 2.
We are now head@@ ing for something simil@@ ar, but on a larger sc@@ al@@ e.
The banks and other financial play@@ ers have every incen@@ tive to lo@@ ad up on risk as we head into the cy@@ cle@@ ; they get the up@@ side (@@ Wall Street compens@@ ation this year is set to break rec@@ or@@ ds again@@ ) and the down@@ side goes to taxpay@@ ers.
The “@@ currency war@@ s” themselves are merely a sk@@ ir@@ mis@@ h@@ .
The big problem is that the core of the world’s financial system has become un@@ stab@@ le, and reck@@ less risk@@ -@@ taking will once again lead to great coll@@ ater@@ al dam@@ age.
At long la@@ st, G@@ ord@@ on B@@ rown is taking over from Tony Blair as Britain@@ ’s Prime Minist@@ er, thus at@@ tain@@ ing his life@@ -@@ long ambi@@ tion, as if by righ@@ t.
That is his first problem.
He has not been elected by anyone – not by the Lab@@ our Par@@ ty, and not by Britain@@ ’s vo@@ ter@@ s; he has merely come into an inher@@ it@@ ance that he has long thought was his du@@ e.
H@@ ow, then, will B@@ rown acqu@@ ire legitimacy as Britain@@ ’s new leader@@ ?
The one thing that is clear is that he will not gain legitimacy if he offers only more of what Blair has been di@@ sh@@ ing up for the past ten years.
B@@ row@@ n@@ ’s second problem is the mir@@ ror ima@@ ge of the fir@@ st.
As a senior member of Bla@@ ir@@ ’s government throughout its ten@@ u@@ re, he shar@@ es responsibility for everything that Blair has don@@ e.
Politi@@ cal com@@ ment@@ ators sometimes claim to de@@ tec@@ t important differences in their underlying political attitu@@ d@@ es.
However, in practic@@ e, B@@ rown has remained in the sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ s, skill@@ fully man@@ aging the economy, but rema@@ ining sil@@ ent and en@@ ig@@ mati@@ c on vital political issu@@ es, and appar@@ ently end@@ or@@ sing everything Blair di@@ d.
If B@@ rown is to gain legitim@@ ac@@ y, he must offer something new@@ ; but he can do that only by dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ish@@ ing himself from the Blair leg@@ acy in clearly perc@@ ep@@ ti@@ ble – and therefore fair@@ ly radical – way@@ s.
This will be a difficult tri@@ ck to pul@@ l off@@ .
Perhaps the single most important domestic question B@@ rown faces concerns where he stands on the balance between the free market and the claims of social policy.
Bla@@ ir@@ ’s government mo@@ ved the Lab@@ our Party a long way to the right of its traditional priori@@ ties of protec@@ ting the under@@ pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge@@ d, and to justi@@ fy the change he re-@@ nam@@ ed the party “@@ New Lab@@ our@@ .”
In many way@@ s, the Blair government’s support of fre@@ e-@@ market policies turned out to be a sh@@ re@@ w@@ d and productive shi@@ ft.
Britain@@ ’s economy gre@@ w more ste@@ adi@@ ly and rapidly than it had done for several gener@@ ations, and the tax reven@@ ue gener@@ ated by growth enab@@ led the government to p@@ our money into education and the National He@@ al@@ th Ser@@ vic@@ e.
But this has come at a pri@@ ce, or rather several pric@@ es.
First, inequality has grow@@ n at both ends of the income sc@@ al@@ e.
At the bo@@ tt@@ om@@ , the propor@@ tion of the population with an income below the poverty line increased from 1@@ 3% at the start of Bla@@ ir@@ ’s government to 20% now.
That situation is much worse among ethnic min@@ ori@@ ties.
And, despite the government’s effor@@ ts, chil@@ d@@ hood poverty also has increased under Bla@@ ir@@ .
At the top@@ , the in@@ comes of the me@@ ga@@ -@@ rich have so@@ ar@@ ed, with predict@@ able re@@ perc@@ us@@ sions, especially in the property market.
Pub@@ li@@ c concern about this issue has been made much worse by claims that the rich get even rich@@ er by pa@@ ying little tax@@ .
There was a time when B@@ rown was thought to be a beli@@ ever in traditional Lab@@ our Party valu@@ es.
Was it tru@@ e?
Is it true now@@ ?
What will he say about inequ@@ alit@@ y?
Unfortunately, Blair and his government are perceived to be tain@@ ted by some of the less attrac@@ tive feat@@ ures of fre@@ e-@@ market capit@@ alism.
Blair himself seems to pre@@ fer to have “@@ friend@@ s” who are very rich and who will l@@ end him their ho@@ li@@ day v@@ ill@@ as in T@@ us@@ can@@ y.
This “@@ clo@@ sen@@ ess@@ ” has led the police to investig@@ ate claims that some Lab@@ our Party don@@ ors have been re@@ war@@ ded with political hon@@ or@@ s.
In shor@@ t, Bla@@ ir@@ ’s government exu@@ des an au@@ ra of s@@ lea@@ ze and c@@ ron@@ y@@ ism.
C@@ an B@@ rown show that he is differ@@ ent@@ ?
The worst part of Bla@@ ir@@ ’s leg@@ ac@@ y, of course, is the war in Iraq.
Many people predic@@ ted, and everyone can now se@@ e, that the decision to inv@@ ade was a disa@@ stro@@ us er@@ ror@@ ; that it is having c@@ atastroph@@ ic consequ@@ enc@@ es, not just for Iraq, but also for the Middle East gener@@ all@@ y; and that it has seri@@ ously dam@@ aged the moral standing of the United States and Britain@@ .
The most critical issue facing B@@ rown is whether he cho@@ o@@ ses to dist@@ ance himself from Bla@@ ir@@ ’s self-@@ sati@@ s@@ fied and del@@ u@@ sion@@ al claim that the inv@@ asion of Iraq was “the right thing to do@@ .”
Britain has already reduced its forces in southern Iraq, and is on course to reduce them still further as they hand over “@@ securit@@ y” to the Iraqi police and milit@@ ary.
In re@@ ality, of course, the civil and gu@@ er@@ ri@@ ll@@ a war under way in the rest of Iraq means that any security in the sou@@ th can only be a temporary illu@@ sion.
The choice facing B@@ rown is whether to cl@@ ing sil@@ ently to the existing policy, in the fu@@ ti@@ le hope that the problem will go a@@ way, or exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly recognize Britain@@ ’s share in the disa@@ st@@ er.
This is partly a question of what to do now in Iraq@@ ; but it is also a question of Britain@@ ’s relationship with the US.
With hin@@ d@@ si@@ gh@@ t, it is clear that Britain@@ ’s particip@@ ation in the Iraq war was driven sol@@ ely by Bla@@ ir@@ ’s determin@@ ation to sti@@ ck li@@ mp@@ et@@ -@@ like to the US.
B@@ rown believ@@ es, and has sa@@ id, that Britain must always be close fri@@ ends with Americ@@ a@@ ; and ob@@ viously that is the right thing to believe and sa@@ y.
But is he prepared to make clear that there is a difference between being close fri@@ ends and going into an il@@ legal and disa@@ stro@@ us war just to p@@ le@@ ase George W Bush@@ ?
So f@@ ar, there is no indic@@ ation that he will@@ .
While he has public@@ ly re@@ gre@@ t@@ ted the er@@ ror@@ s in British intel@@ ligence about Saddam Hus@@ sein, that is merely a way of shif@@ ting the blam@@ e from the government to the intel@@ ligence servic@@ es.
But it was not the intel@@ ligence services that decided to go to war@@ ; it was Tony Bla@@ ir@@ , with the support of G@@ ord@@ on B@@ row@@ n.
PR@@ IN@@ CE@@ T@@ ON – Now that the economic crisis looks less threat@@ ening (@@ at least for the moment@@ ), and forec@@ ast@@ ers are sp@@ ying “@@ gre@@ en sho@@ o@@ ts@@ ” of recover@@ y, an ever more en@@ comp@@ ass@@ ing blam@@ e g@@ ame is un@@ fol@@ d@@ ing.
The financial crisis provides an appar@@ ently end@@ less opportunity for un@@ mas@@ king dec@@ ei@@ t, mal@@ fe@@ as@@ ance, and corrup@@ tion.
But we are not s@@ ure quite who and what should be un@@ mas@@ k@@ ed.
Le@@ ad@@ ing bank@@ ers were initi@@ ally the most obvious cul@@ pri@@ ts.
They pres@@ ided over institutions that made large prof@@ its for a substantial period of time by mis@@ pric@@ ing ris@@ k, and then argued for public support on the ground@@ s that they were too big to fail@@ .
They appe@@ ared ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ t and over@@ pa@@ id, and were easily demon@@ iz@@ ed.
But what about the political proc@@ ess@@ ?
Why were the banks not more clo@@ sely controlled and better regul@@ at@@ ed@@ ?
It is not that politicians were “@@ b@@ ough@@ t” in a simple sen@@ se@@ ; ra@@ ther, they convinc@@ ed themselves that financial innov@@ ation op@@ ened the g@@ ate to greater general prosper@@ ity, increased home owner@@ ship, and, of course, popular support in elec@@ tions.
Govern@@ ments are now vulner@@ able, and politicians are under attack almost every@@ wher@@ e.
Administ@@ ra@@ tions have collap@@ sed in the C@@ ze@@ ch Republi@@ c, Hung@@ ary, I@@ cel@@ and, and I@@ rel@@ and.
Ri@@ o@@ ts and par@@ aly@@ zing strik@@ es have cri@@ p@@ pl@@ ed Thail@@ and, France, and Greec@@ e.
In Ku@@ wa@@ it, the government dis@@ mis@@ sed parliament@@ .
Britain is con@@ vul@@ sed by a sc@@ and@@ al about parliamentary exp@@ ens@@ es that has no equi@@ valent since the attacks on “@@ old corrup@@ tion@@ ” in the early n@@ ine@@ te@@ enth century.
Rec@@ ri@@ min@@ ations after financial crises have a long history, and they rec@@ ur in regul@@ ar cy@@ cl@@ es.
The stock exchange boom of the early 18@@ 7@@ 0’s was followed by collapse in 18@@ 7@@ 3 and a wit@@ ch@@ -@@ h@@ un@@ t for those responsi@@ ble.
In 19@@ 0@@ 7, J@@ .@@ P@@ . Mor@@ g@@ an was first viewed as the sa@@ vi@@ or of the market, and then as the enem@@ y of the com@@ mon@@ we@@ al.
In the 193@@ 0’s, bank@@ ers and finance ministers were acc@@ us@@ ed.
But for the rest of the twenti@@ eth century, the b@@ ac@@ kl@@ ash cy@@ cle seemed to have stopp@@ ed.
Toda@@ y the attacks are not limited to the political and financial establish@@ ment.
Cri@@ tics are trying to identi@@ fy the ideas as well as the interests that were responsible for financial and economic dy@@ sf@@ unc@@ tion.
In this respec@@ t, the con@@ temporary crisis is un@@ like the historical an@@ alo@@ gi@@ es, in that it looks as if financial innov@@ ation was driven by a set of intellectual and even technological innov@@ ations.
Since it is an economic crisis, most people seeking its intellectual roo@@ ts are temp@@ ted to begin with econom@@ ist@@ s, wh@@ o, with a few excep@@ tions, look particularly dis@@ credi@@ ted.
The fo@@ under of the rational expect@@ ations revolu@@ tion, Robert Lu@@ c@@ as, is end@@ less@@ ly quo@@ ted as having st@@ ated in 2003 in his presidential address to the American Economic As@@ soci@@ ation that the “@@ central problem of de@@ pres@@ sion@@ -@@ pre@@ vention has been solv@@ ed, for all prac@@ tical pur@@ pos@@ es, and has in fact been sol@@ ved for many decad@@ es@@ .”
It is also clear that academ@@ ic economists had an impact on policy.
L@@ ar@@ ry Sum@@ mer@@ s, now the highly influ@@ ential direc@@ tor of President Barack Obama’s National Economic Counc@@ il, conclu@@ ded as a young econom@@ ist that “@@ financial and monetary shock@@ s are less important sources of de@@ pression than we had susp@@ ec@@ ted@@ .” If the economy was fo@@ ol@@ pro@@ of@@ , and if so many good policy op@@ tions exist@@ ed to deal with crisis and dist@@ res@@ s, there was less need to avoid mistak@@ es.
Th@@ ings could always be set right re@@ tro@@ spec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y.
Other academ@@ ic discipl@@ ines have look@@ ed rather s@@ mu@@ gly at the public hum@@ ili@@ ation of their colle@@ agu@@ es in economic@@ s.
The non-@@ ma@@ themati@@ cal appear to have their reven@@ ge, as the per@@ il@@ s of over-@@ reli@@ ance on complex symboli@@ c no@@ tation and ar@@ can@@ e form@@ ul@@ a@@ e are rel@@ ent@@ less@@ ly ex@@ pos@@ ed.
In fact, develop@@ ments or fas@@ hi@@ ons in other academ@@ ic discipl@@ ines and also in the general culture contribut@@ ed at least as much to a willingness to eng@@ age in ab@@ sur@@ d risks and to provide and accept valu@@ ations of complex and inher@@ ently un@@ fa@@ th@@ om@@ able securi@@ ties.
The general cultural develop@@ ments are sometimes term@@ ed post-@@ moder@@ nis@@ m, which invol@@ ves the re@@ plac@@ ement of reason by in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion, feel@@ ing, and all@@ u@@ sion.
But post-@@ moder@@ nis@@ m has itself been gener@@ ated by technolog@@ y, with which it has a deeply am@@ big@@ u@@ ous relation@@ ship.
In contra@@ st to a ste@@ am eng@@ ine or an old@@ -@@ fas@@ hi@@ oned autom@@ ob@@ i@@ le, whose oper@@ ations were easily compreh@@ ensi@@ ble, modern autom@@ ob@@ il@@ es or air@@ plan@@ es are so complic@@ ated that their oper@@ ators have no idea how the technology they are using actually work@@ s.
The Internet has created a world in which stri@@ c@@ t logi@@ c is less important than the ju@@ x@@ ta@@ position of stri@@ king ima@@ ges.
Po@@ st-@@ moder@@ nis@@ m mo@@ ves away from the rational culture of the so-called “@@ modern er@@ a@@ .”
Many people are fin@@ ding more an@@ alo@@ gi@@ es with medi@@ ev@@ al lif@@ e, in which hum@@ ans were sur@@ ro@@ unded by proc@@ esses that they found difficult to compreh@@ end.
As a result, they thought they li@@ ved in a world popul@@ ated by demon@@ s and my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous forc@@ es.
The recent era of global finance – perhaps we should spe@@ ak of it as being past@@ ? – differ@@ ed from the financial sur@@ ge of a century ago.
Its cultural mani@@ fest@@ ations also appe@@ ared to be no@@ vel@@ .
It was play@@ ful@@ , all@@ usi@@ ve, and ed@@ g@@ y – in shor@@ t, post-@@ moder@@ n.
It tre@@ ated tradi@@ tion and history not as a constra@@ in@@ t, but as a source of ir@@ on@@ ic refer@@ ence.
At the er@@ a’s hei@@ gh@@ t, major financial play@@ ers built v@@ ast@@ ly exp@@ ensive collec@@ tions of highly ab@@ st@@ rac@@ t modern ar@@ t.
A post-@@ modern neg@@ lec@@ t or dis@@ da@@ in for reality gener@@ ated the sense that the whole world was con@@ st@@ antly shif@@ ting and m@@ alle@@ able, and might be as transi@@ ent and mean@@ ing@@ less as stock quo@@ t@@ ations.
An alliance was form@@ ed between financial exper@@ ts who thought they were s@@ elling truly innov@@ ative ide@@ as, a political eli@@ te that end@@ or@@ sed the philosop@@ h@@ y of “@@ regulation li@@ te@@ ,” and a cultural climate that push@@ ed experi@@ ment@@ ation and the rejec@@ tion of traditional valu@@ es.
The result was that every sort of value – including financial values – came to be seen as ar@@ bit@@ r@@ ary and fundament@@ ally ab@@ sur@@ d.
When in@@ compreh@@ en@@ sion no longer produ@@ ces new hei@@ gh@@ ts of prosper@@ ity, but rather economic collapse and fail@@ u@@ re, it is not surpri@@ sing that it tur@@ ns to an@@ ger.
Fin@@ ding out who is to blam@@ e becomes more and more like the late medi@@ ev@@ al and early modern se@@ ar@@ ch for wit@@ ch@@ es: a way of making sense of a dis@@ order@@ ly and hosti@@ le uni@@ ver@@ se.
CAMBRIDGE – Yo@@ u don’t have to break a s@@ we@@ at to be a finance skep@@ tic these da@@ y@@ s.
So let@@ ’s remin@@ d our@@ sel@@ ves how comp@@ elling the logi@@ c of the financial innov@@ ation that led us to our current predic@@ ament seemed not too long ag@@ o@@ . 
Wh@@ o w@@ oul@@ d@@ n’t want credit markets to serve the cause of home owner@@ ship@@ ?
So we start by introduc@@ ing some real competition into the mortg@@ age lending bus@@ ines@@ s.
We allow non-@@ banks to make home loans and let them offer cre@@ ative, more aff@@ ord@@ able mortg@@ ages to prospec@@ tive hom@@ e@@ ow@@ ners not well ser@@ ved by conventional len@@ der@@ s@@ . 
Th@@ en we enable these loans to be po@@ ol@@ ed and pack@@ aged into securi@@ ties that can be sol@@ d to invest@@ ors, reducing risk in the process.
We di@@ v@@ v@@ y up the stre@@ am of pay@@ ments on these home loans further into tran@@ ches of v@@ ar@@ ying ris@@ k, compens@@ ating hol@@ ders of the risk@@ ier kind with higher interest rates.
We then call on credit rating agen@@ cies to cer@@ ti@@ fy that the less risk@@ y of these mort@@ ga@@ ge-@@ backed securi@@ ties are safe enough for pension funds and insurance companies to invest in.
In case anyone is still ner@@ vo@@ us, we create deri@@ v@@ atives that allow investors to purch@@ ase insurance against default by issu@@ ers of those securi@@ ti@@ es@@ .@@     @@    
If you wanted to show@@ case the benefits of financial innov@@ ation, you could not have come up with better arran@@ ge@@ ments.
Th@@ anks to them, millions of poor@@ er and hi@@ ther@@ to exclu@@ ded famili@@ es became hom@@ e@@ owner@@ s, investors made high retur@@ n@@ s, and financial inter@@ medi@@ aries po@@ ck@@ et@@ ed the fe@@ es and com@@ mission@@ s.
It might have worked like a dre@@ am – and until about a year and a half ago, many financi@@ ers, econom@@ ist@@ s, and policymakers thought that it did@@ . 
Th@@ en it all came cra@@ sh@@ ing dow@@ n.
The crisis that eng@@ ul@@ f@@ ed financial markets in recent months has bu@@ ried Wall Street and hum@@ b@@ led the United Stat@@ es.
The near $@@ 1 trillion bail@@ out of troub@@ led financial institutions that the US Treasury has had to moun@@ t makes emerg@@ ing-@@ market mel@@ t@@ dow@@ ns – such as Mexico@@ ’s “@@ p@@ es@@ o@@ ” crisis in 199@@ 4 or the Asian financial crisis of 199@@ 7-@@ 1998 – look like fo@@ ot@@ no@@ tes by compar@@ is@@ on@@ . @@  
But where did it all go wron@@ g@@ ?
If our re@@ me@@ dies do not target the true underlying sources of the crisis, our new@@ found regulatory ze@@ al might end up kill@@ ing us@@ eful sor@@ ts of financial innov@@ ation, along with the tox@@ ic kin@@ d.
The troub@@ le is that there is no shor@@ tage of susp@@ ec@@ ts.
Was the problem un@@ sc@@ ru@@ pul@@ ous mortg@@ age len@@ ders who de@@ vis@@ ed credit terms – such as “@@ te@@ as@@ er@@ ” interest rates and pre@@ pay@@ ment pen@@ al@@ ties – that led uns@@ us@@ p@@ ec@@ ting bor@@ ro@@ wer@@ s into a debt tra@@ p@@ ?
Perh@@ ap@@ s, but these strategi@@ es would not have made sense for len@@ ders unless they believed that house prices would continue to ri@@ se@@ . 
So ma@@ y@@ be the cul@@ pri@@ t is the housing bub@@ ble that developed in the late 199@@ 0’s, and the rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ance of Al@@ an Greensp@@ an’s Federal Reserve to defl@@ ate it.
Even so, the explo@@ sion in the quanti@@ ty of coll@@ ater@@ alized debt oblig@@ ations and similar securi@@ ties went far beyond what was needed to su@@ sta@@ in mortg@@ age l@@ end@@ ing.
That was also true of credit default s@@ w@@ ap@@ s, which became an instru@@ ment of spec@@ ulation instead of insurance and reached an ast@@ o@@ und@@ ing $@@ 6@@ 2 trillion in volum@@ e.
So the crisis might not have reached the scale that it did without financial institutions of all typ@@ es lever@@ aging themselves to the hil@@ t in pursu@@ it of higher retur@@ n@@ s.
But wh@@ at, then, were the credit rating agen@@ cies do@@ ing@@ ?
H@@ ad they done their job proper@@ ly and issu@@ ed tim@@ ely warn@@ ings about the risk@@ s, these markets would not have su@@ ck@@ ed in nearly as many investors as they eventually di@@ d.
Is@@ n’t this the cru@@ x of the mat@@ ter@@ ?
O@@ r perhaps the true cul@@ pri@@ ts li@@ e hal@@ f@@ way around the world.
H@@ igh@@ -@@ saving Asian households and doll@@ ar-@@ ho@@ ar@@ ding foreign central banks produced a global savings “@@ gl@@ ut@@ ,” which push@@ ed real interest rates into negative terri@@ tor@@ y, in turn st@@ ok@@ ing the US housing bub@@ ble while sen@@ ding financi@@ ers on ever@@ -@@ risk@@ ier v@@ ent@@ ures with borrow@@ ed mone@@ y.
M@@ ac@@ ro@@ economic policymakers could have go@@ tten their act together and ac@@ ted in time to un@@ win@@ d those large and un@@ sustainable current-account im@@ balanc@@ es.
Th@@ en there would not have been so much liquidity s@@ lo@@ sh@@ ing around wa@@ iting for an ac@@ ci@@ dent to happ@@ en.
But perhaps what really go@@ t us into the m@@ ess is that the US Treasury played its hand poor@@ ly as the crisis un@@ fol@@ ded.
As bad as things wer@@ e, what caused credit markets to sei@@ ze up was Treasury Secretary H@@ en@@ ry P@@ aul@@ son@@ ’s ref@@ us@@ al to b@@ ail out Leh@@ man Bro@@ ther@@ s.
Im@@ medi@@ ately after that deci@@ sion, short-term funding for even the best@@ -@@ capit@@ alized firms virtually collap@@ sed and the entire financial system simply became dy@@ sf@@ unc@@ tion@@ al@@ . 
In view of what was about to happ@@ en, it might have been better for P@@ aul@@ son to hold his no@@ se and do with Leh@@ man what he had already done with Be@@ ar S@@ te@@ ar@@ ns and would have had to do in a few days with A@@ I@@ G@@ : save them with taxpay@@ er mone@@ y.
Wall Street might have survi@@ v@@ ed, and US taxpay@@ ers might have been spar@@ ed even larger b@@ ill@@ s.
Perhaps it is fu@@ ti@@ le to look for the single cause without which the financial system would not have b@@ low@@ n up in our fac@@ es.
A com@@ for@@ ting thought – if you still want to believe in financial san@@ ity – is that this was a case of a “@@ perf@@ ect stor@@ m@@ ,” a r@@ are failure that required a large number of star@@ s to be in ali@@ gn@@ ment si@@ mul@@ tane@@ ous@@ ly.
So what will the post-@@ mor@@ tem on Wall Street show@@ ?
That it was a case of su@@ ici@@ de@@ ?
M@@ ur@@ der@@ ?
Ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ al death@@ ?
O@@ r was it a r@@ are inst@@ ance of gener@@ alized org@@ an fail@@ u@@ re@@ ?
We will likely never know@@ .
The regul@@ ations and prec@@ au@@ tions that law@@ makers will en@@ act to prevent its rec@@ ur@@ ren@@ ce will therefore necess@@ arily remain bl@@ un@@ t and of un@@ certain effec@@ tiven@@ ess.
That is why you can be s@@ ure that we will have another major financial crisis some@@ time in the futu@@ re, once this one has dis@@ appe@@ ared into the rec@@ esses of our mem@@ or@@ y.
Yo@@ u can be@@ t your life savings on it.
In fact, you probably will@@ .
Wh@@ o lost Russi@@ a@@ ?
This question remains ho@@ tly deb@@ ated in media and policy cir@@ cl@@ es across the Wes@@ t.
The question seems to pres@@ up@@ pos@@ e, not only that Russia was lo@@ st, but also that if some@@ one in America’s government, the IMF@@ , or EU head@@ quar@@ ters had been pa@@ ying more attention or had de@@ voted more resources towards helping Russia’s government, the results would have been bet@@ ter.
But hardly anyone today thin@@ ks the West should have been put@@ ting more money into Russia, or even that it should have been helping Y@@ el@@ ts@@ in, and now Put@@ in, to a greater extent than it has be@@ en.
An op@@ posing cri@@ ti@@ qu@@ e, favor@@ ed by some of George W. Bush’s advis@@ ors, hol@@ ds that the Clinton Administration tried too hard to help@@ , not that it did not try hard enough@@ .
There is something contra@@ dic@@ tory about using the ph@@ ra@@ se “@@ Wh@@ o lost Russi@@ a@@ ?@@ ” to mean that the US tried too hard to help@@ .
The har@@ sh@@ est critic@@ ism comes from those (@@ including some Bush advis@@ er@@ s) who say America and the West sent money down a rat@@ -@@ hol@@ e instead of following the practi@@ ce adopted to fighting some wil@@ d@@ fi@@ res B i@@ e, standing back and let@@ ting the fl@@ am@@ es bur@@ n themselves out.
All in all, the pati@@ ently c@@ ali@@ b@@ rated approach of the last ei@@ ght years has been right for the most par@@ t.
F@@ e@@ w will agree with this, probably not even those responsible for conduc@@ ting Russia policy over the past years.
So let me ad@@ d that I do not claim that things are good in Russia, nor that American and Western policy had much positive effect ther@@ e, nor that there is@@ n’t corrup@@ tion, mis@@ er@@ y, and their like in ab@@ und@@ ance across Russia.
Of course, the current situation for the West is more sati@@ s@@ factor@@ y, not only from where it was 10 or 20 years ago, when the Soviet Uni@@ on’s fall did not appear even a remo@@ te possi@@ bilit@@ y, but also from where it might have been given Russia’s economic har@@ d@@ ship and social inst@@ ability.
Russia pul@@ led back from hy@@ per@@ inflation in 199@@ 5@@ ; it has not ve@@ ered off either toward righ@@ t@@ wing dictator@@ ship nor back to Commun@@ ism@@ ; nor has it entirely de@@ gener@@ ated into an@@ arch@@ ic cha@@ o@@ s.
This is an accompli@@ sh@@ ment consider@@ ing that Russia never had historical experience with any sort of democracy or market system.
Russia probably h@@ as@@ n’t even done as b@@ adly as Ukra@@ ine, Bel@@ ar@@ us, and Central Asi@@ a.
But I don’t claim that America and the West necess@@ arily had much effect on this outcome B beyond doing what they do best@@ : th@@ ri@@ ving dom@@ es@@ tic@@ ally, and thus making others want to become free market democ@@ rat@@ s.
What happ@@ ens in Russia is mainly determined by Russi@@ ans.
Consider specific policy choic@@ es faced by the West and the specific decisions ma@@ de, not an imag@@ in@@ ary men@@ u that includes the op@@ tion “@@ Est@@ abli@@ sh the rule of law fir@@ st, elimin@@ ate corruption and inequ@@ ality, then proc@@ e@@ ed with market reforms and a@@ id@@ .”
That combin@@ ation of choic@@ es was never an op@@ tion.
The West@@ ’s choic@@ es attemp@@ ted to stri@@ ke a balance between too much and too litt@@ le.
The big decisions inclu@@ de@@ d@@ :
• appro@@ ving Russian membership in the IMF in 199@@ 2 and immedi@@ ately giving it a $@@ 1 billion stand@@ -@@ by arran@@ ge@@ ment, with the us@@ ual condi@@ tions@@ ;
• working clo@@ sely with Y@@ el@@ t@@ sin in the run@@ -@@ up to Russia’s presidential election in 199@@ 6 and there@@ af@@ ter, despite his personal short@@ com@@ ings and the du@@ bi@@ ous “@@ shar@@ es@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ lo@@ ans@@ ” privati@@ z@@ ations of the sum@@ mer of 199@@ 5@@ ;
• sub@@ sequ@@ ently au@@ g@@ ment@@ ing the IMF lending agreement by making more resources available even though most of the conditions set pre@@ viously had not been me@@ t, in particular the elimin@@ ation of un@@ sustain@@ ably large Russian budget deficits because of a poor@@ l@@ y-@@ func@@ tioning national tax collec@@ tion system@@ ;
• pul@@ ling the pl@@ u@@ g in August 1998 when the IMF program did@@ n’t work (@@ much IMF money having quickly flow@@ ed back out of the banking system@@ ), with the result that the Russians immedi@@ ately de@@ valu@@ ed the ru@@ ble, defaul@@ ted on domestic debt, and imposed contro@@ ls on capital out@@ flows (@@ wh@@ ence con@@ ta@@ gi@@ on spread throughout the world, in the worst ph@@ ase of the 199@@ 7-@@ 9@@ 8 financial tur@@ mo@@ il@@ )@@ ;
• ad@@ ding new conditions to those required for an IMF program in the lat@@ ter part of 199@@ 9.
Although the od@@ ds for success in 199@@ 1@@ -@@ 2 were not gre@@ at, the West had to tr@@ y.
Not to try would have sent a sign@@ al that the West would never help@@ .
And, despite “@@ moral ha@@ z@@ ard@@ ,” about which we now he@@ ar so much and which everyone agre@@ es was greatest in respect to nu@@ cle@@ ar-@@ armed Russia, the West did let Russia default in 199@@ 8@@ .
This was a lesson for the world B deb@@ tors and credi@@ tors ali@@ ke B that condi@@ tion@@ ality is more than m@@ ere rhetor@@ ic@@ , and bail@@ ou@@ ts are not un@@ limit@@ ed.
Europeans comp@@ la@@ in that the US used the IMF as a to@@ ol for its pur@@ pos@@ es.
It may be true that the mand@@ ate of the IMF@@ , which is supposed to make decisions stri@@ c@@ tly on objec@@ tive economic cri@@ ter@@ ia rather than broader political go@@ als, was stre@@ t@@ ched at tim@@ es.
America, in particul@@ ar, may have given Russia more attention than another country would ha@@ ve.
But the basic IMF principle of condi@@ tion@@ ality was not t@@ wi@@ sted until un@@ recogni@@ z@@ able.
In the real world there was no other way of help@@ ing.
E@@ ver@@ y@@ one, not just Americ@@ ans, has a st@@ ake in Russia prosper@@ ing peac@@ eful@@ ly.
In gener@@ al, the gu@@ iding principle in the future should be to continue to stand ready to help Russia if social and political conditions suppor@@ tive of the rule of law and economic reform mani@@ f@@ est themsel@@ ves.
Stand@@ ing ready includes mu@@ ster@@ ing more domestic support for assistance than is currently avail@@ able, not whi@@ pp@@ ing up anti-@@ Russian feel@@ ings with sup@@ pos@@ edly new dis@@ cover@@ ies of mone@@ y-@@ la@@ under@@ ing.
But support should always be condi@@ tional on fundament@@ als.
In the end, the West must recognize that much of the time there is little that can be don@@ e.
PAR@@ I@@ S – “@@ Wh@@ o lost Turke@@ y@@ ?@@ ” That ques@@ tion, often raised in the past@@ , has been he@@ ating up in the after@@ mat@@ h of Prime Minister Rec@@ ep Ta@@ y@@ y@@ i@@ p Erdo@@ gan@@ ’s emo@@ tional out@@ bur@@ st during the recent World Economic For@@ um 2009 in Da@@ vo@@ s, when he ab@@ rup@@ tly left a pan@@ el he was shar@@ ing with Israeli President Sh@@ im@@ on Per@@ es.
And the Turkish question matters great@@ ly, because it tou@@ ches on some of the most un@@ stable and uns@@ ett@@ ling of the world’s diplomatic disp@@ ut@@ es.
If Turkey has inde@@ ed been “@@ lo@@ st@@ ,” those responsible include the European Union, the United States, Israel, and Turkey itself.
The EU’s growing reser@@ v@@ ations about Turkey’s membership have been ex@@ pressed un@@ am@@ big@@ u@@ ously by French President Nicolas Sarkoz@@ y.
In the US, former President George W. Bush ge@@ ts some of the blam@@ e because of the war in Iraq.
Israel, too, has played its part in Turkey’s alien@@ ation from the Wes@@ t, as a result of the Leban@@ on war of 2006 and its recent military oper@@ ations in Gaz@@ a.
All of these events have dist@@ ur@@ bed and dis@@ ori@@ ented Turke@@ y, and are ma@@ gni@@ fied by the domestic impact of worst global economic crisis since the 193@@ 0’s.
Of course, Turkey’s sec@@ ul@@ ar, pro-@@ Western eli@@ tes may still consider the EU and the US import@@ ant, if not indi@@ sp@@ ens@@ able, allies and partn@@ ers, and they may consider Islamic fundament@@ alism, Ham@@ as, Hez@@ boll@@ ah, and Iran real or at least potential threat@@ s.
Yet they are also convinc@@ ed that Europe has beha@@ ved impro@@ per@@ ly toward Turke@@ y, through a combin@@ ation of short-term populi@@ st ref@@ lex@@ es and the absence of a long-term strategic vi@@ sion.
The Turkish question is, of course, comp@@ lex@@ .
Turkey’s geo@@ graph@@ y is pre@@ domin@@ antly Asi@@ an, Turkey’s emo@@ tions are increasingly Middle East@@ ern, i@@ .@@ e@@ ., Muslim on the Israeli@@ -@@ Palestinian conflic@@ t, and yet Turkey’s eli@@ tes remain resol@@ ut@@ ely pro-@@ Western and pro-@@ Europe@@ an.
But for how lon@@ g@@ ?
At the beginning of the twent@@ y-@@ first century, when dialo@@ gue with the Islamic world is one of the Western world’s key challen@@ ges, Europe would com@@ mit a histor@@ ic strategic bl@@ under if it were to close its do@@ ors to Turke@@ y.
To do so would push back the inher@@ it@@ ors of the O@@ tt@@ om@@ an Emp@@ ire back on@@ to an Asi@@ an, Muslim@@ , and Middle Eastern historical tra@@ jec@@ tor@@ y.
In the question of Turkish acc@@ ession to the EU, the j@@ our@@ ney matters more than the dest@@ in@@ ation.
The reforms that Turkey has already implement@@ ed in a very short period of time, th@@ anks to its EU candidate stat@@ us, are im@@ pres@@ si@@ ve.
Sh@@ ould we in Europe really put at risk that progress by ex@@ press@@ ing an all-@@ to@@ o-@@ au@@ di@@ ble “@@ no@@ ”@@ ?
The EU des@@ per@@ ately needs a strategic and diplomatic partn@@ er that can significantly rein@@ force its cl@@ out in the Middle East@@ .
Europe also needs the dynam@@ ism of a you@@ th@@ ful Turke@@ y.
A@@ bo@@ ve all, it needs the message of re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation sent to Islam that Turkey’s ent@@ ran@@ ce into the Union would repres@@ ent.
Of course, to want Turkey “@@ in@@ ” is an act of will, if not an act of fa@@ ith that is in many ways counter@@ in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive.
Most Europeans do not percei@@ ve Turkey as a “@@ European O@@ ther@@ ” but as a “@@ non-@@ European O@@ ther@@ .”
Even in I@@ stan@@ bul@@ , the most Wes@@ ter@@ ni@@ zed of Turkish ci@@ ties, as soon as one lea@@ ves the main ar@@ teri@@ es, one seems to be im@@ mer@@ sed in a Middle Eastern or Asian cultu@@ re.
Israel is not in the European Union, but it, too, is in great danger of los@@ ing Turke@@ y.
F@@ ar from rein@@ forc@@ ing Israel’s security, its last two military adv@@ ent@@ ures, in Leban@@ on and now in Gaz@@ a, have caused further self-@@ isol@@ ation and loss of world symp@@ ath@@ y.
No@@ where has this ph@@ en@@ omen@@ on been stronger than in Turke@@ y, where those military es@@ cap@@ a@@ des have stra@@ ined the two countries’ strategic alliance almost to the break@@ ing poin@@ t.
It is too early to spe@@ ak of Obama’s policy towards Turke@@ y; suff@@ ice it to say that in his willingness to open a respec@@ t@@ ful dialo@@ gue with Islam@@ , he is the only Western leader to move in the right direc@@ tion.
But can positive American gest@@ ures towards Turke@@ y, a key NATO member@@ , be sufficient to off@@ set Israel’s in@@ sensi@@ tive, if not reck@@ l@@ ess, polici@@ es?
The answer is un@@ cle@@ ar.
Turke@@ y, too shar@@ es some of the responsibility for this moun@@ ting process of est@@ ran@@ ge@@ ment@@ .  Erdo@@ gan@@ ’s behavior in Da@@ vo@@ s w@@ as, at the very lea@@ st, ir@@ responsi@@ ble.
He may have gain@@ ed popul@@ arity back hom@@ e, but in today’s difficult economic tim@@ es, the temp@@ t@@ ations of che@@ ap populi@@ sm are more dangerous than ever@@ .
One does not play ligh@@ tly with mat@@ ches next to a p@@ ile of dr@@ y wo@@ od.
W@@ AS@@ HI@@ NG@@ T@@ ON@@ , D@@ C – With America’s Republican presidential candidates lin@@ ing up to decl@@ are their fe@@ al@@ ty to a fl@@ at tax – a system of person@@ al-@@ income tax@@ ation that ass@@ esses a single rate for all – oppon@@ ents have focused on why it is a bad idea to raise taxes on the poor in order to reduce them for the weal@@ th@@ y.
But, if a fl@@ at tax is such a bad ide@@ a, why have so many countries emb@@ rac@@ ed it@@ ?
A car@@ eful study of these countries – mainly post-@@ communist countries in Eastern Europe and a sm@@ at@@ ter@@ ing of tin@@ y m@@ icro@@ -@@ states worldwide – suggests that there are three main reason@@ s@@ .@@ &#160;@@ First, some countries are so relatively poor and lack@@ ing in domestic capital that they op@@ t to dro@@ p rates in order to attrac@@ t foreign invest@@ or@@ s@@ .@@ &#160;@@ Other countries are so small and in@@ effective at collec@@ ting reven@@ ue that they cannot afford a progres@@ sive tax system@@ .@@ &#160;@@ Finally, some countries are so corrup@@ t that they have to offer the weal@@ thy a huge rate cut to get them to pay any taxes at all.
The United States, like other developed countries, does not suff@@ er from any of these conditions (@@ y@@ et@@ ), so it is not clear why it needs a fl@@ at tax@@ .
The form@@ er@@ ly communist countries of Eastern Europe that have adopted a fl@@ at tax – including B@@ ul@@ g@@ ari@@ a, the C@@ ze@@ ch Republi@@ c, Est@@ oni@@ a, Lat@@ vi@@ a, Li@@ th@@ u@@ ani@@ a, M@@ ac@@ ed@@ oni@@ a, Rom@@ ani@@ a, S@@ lo@@ v@@ ak@@ i@@ a, and Ukra@@ ine, among others – sor@@ ely lack investment capit@@ al@@ .@@ &#160;@@ W@@ he@@ ther on the European Uni@@ on’s do@@ or@@ step or just insi@@ de, they compe@@ te for the attention of foreign direct invest@@ ors, for whom a fl@@ at tax provides an important sign@@ al@@ : Yo@@ u are wel@@ come, we will not ste@@ al your mone@@ y, and you can keep what you ear@@ n.
For developed countries that already have capital and a tra@@ ck record of in@@ ward invest@@ ment, “the appe@@ al of the fl@@ at tax is consequ@@ ently less@@ ,” as a report by the International Monetary Fund conclu@@ des@@ .@@ &#160;@@ Thus, the fl@@ at tax has not been adopted in any developed countries, or in China.
The other countries that have emb@@ rac@@ ed a fl@@ at tax are small or m@@ icro@@ -@@ stat@@ es: J@@ am@@ a@@ ic@@ a, Tu@@ valu@@ , Gren@@ ad@@ a, M@@ au@@ ri@@ ti@@ us, Tim@@ or@@ -@@ L@@ es@@ te, Be@@ liz@@ e, and S@@ ey@@ ch@@ ell@@ es@@ .@@ &#160;@@ The only (@@ parti@@ al@@ ) excep@@ tion to this rule is Par@@ agu@@ a@@ y, which adopted a fl@@ at tax in 201@@ 0.
Her@@ e, fl@@ at@@ -@@ tax advoc@@ at@@ es’ administ@@ rati@@ ve-@@ simp@@ lic@@ ity argum@@ ents have some trac@@ tion@@ .@@ &#160;@@ If a country is so small that it cannot develop a tax administration effective enough to manage a fair system of progres@@ sive tax@@ ation, then a fl@@ at tax may make sen@@ se.
Moreover, some small countries have other sources of revenu@@ e, so the benefit of implement@@ ing a progres@@ sive tax system does not justi@@ fy the co@@ st.
Tu@@ valu@@ ’s government, for example, deri@@ ves nearly 10% of its revenu@@ es from the s@@ ale of rights to its “@@ .@@ t@@ v@@ ” Internet dom@@ ain nam@@ e, which br@@ ings in about $@@ 2 million annu@@ all@@ y@@ .@@ &#160;@@ Coun@@ tries that are just s@@ ligh@@ tly larger can afford to collec@@ t income taxes in a fair@@ er way.
Finally, if a country’s public institutions are in the th@@ r@@ all of oli@@ g@@ arch@@ s who are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to ste@@ aling with imp@@ unity from the public ti@@ ll@@ , a fl@@ at tax may be the only way to in@@ duce the weal@@ thy to pay any tax at all@@ .@@ &#160;@@ Thus, in 2001 Russia became the first large state to adop@@ t a fl@@ at tax@@ , reducing the top margin@@ al rate from 3@@ 0% to 1@@ 3@@ %@@ .@@ &#160;@@ In 200@@ 3, Ukraine dro@@ pped its top rate from 40% to 1@@ 3@@ %.
In nearly all countries that have introduc@@ ed a fl@@ at tax@@ , government revenu@@ es from income tax have decl@@ in@@ ed.
That is why its adop@@ tion is often associated with an increase in valu@@ e-@@ added tax rates (@@ as has occur@@ red throughout Eastern Europe@@ ).
In the US, the Republican presidential candidate Her@@ man C@@ ain@@ ’s “@@ 9@@ -@@ 9@@ -@@ 9@@ ” plan calls for a 9@@ % rate for personal and corporate tax@@ es, together with a new 9@@ % national s@@ ales tax@@ .
A country’s tax system reflects its institutional capac@@ ity, economic circum@@ st@@ ances, and distribution of political power.
If the US were to become the first developed country to experi@@ ment with a fl@@ at tax@@ , that shift would tend to con@@ fir@@ m what many susp@@ ect but hope is not tru@@ e: that America is bro@@ k@@ e, des@@ per@@ ate for in@@ ward invest@@ ment, in@@ comp@@ et@@ ently govern@@ ed, and increasingly rul@@ ed by a self-@@ regar@@ ding oli@@ g@@ arch@@ ic eli@@ te.
W@@ AR@@ W@@ IC@@ K@@ , U@@ K – N@@ ow@@ ad@@ ay@@ s, in country after country, policymakers have become ob@@ s@@ essed with the need to strengthen science educ@@ ation.
But what about the hum@@ ani@@ ties –@@  @@ all those discipl@@ ines (@@ liter@@ at@@ u@@ re, history, langu@@ ag@@ es, and so for@@ th@@ ) whose relev@@ ance to economic competi@@ tiveness is not so ob@@ vi@@ ous@@ ?
We need the hum@@ ani@@ ties only if we are committed to the idea of human@@ ity.
If the hum@@ ani@@ ties have become ob@@ sol@@ e@@ te, then it may be that human@@ ity is los@@ ing its s@@ ali@@ ence.
I do not mean that we are becoming “@@ less human@@ ” in the sense of “@@ in@@ human@@ e.”
If any@@ th@@ ing, we live in a time when tradition@@ ally human@@ -@@ cent@@ ered concerns like “@@ righ@@ ts@@ ” have been exten@@ ded to anim@@ als, if not nature as a whol@@ e.
R@@ ath@@ er, the problem is whether there is anything distinc@@ tive about being human that makes special demands of higher educ@@ ation.
I believe that the answer continues to be y@@ es.
Today, it so@@ und@@ s old@@ -@@ fas@@ hi@@ oned to descri@@ be the universi@@ t@@ y’s pur@@ pose as being to “@@ cul@@ tiv@@ at@@ e” people, as if it were a gl@@ ori@@ fied fin@@ ish@@ ing school@@ .
However, once we set asi@@ de its eli@@ ti@@ st history, there remains a strong el@@ ement of truth to this ide@@ a, especially when app@@ lied to the hum@@ ani@@ ties.
Although we now think of academ@@ ic discipl@@ in@@ es, including the hum@@ ani@@ ties, as being “@@ resear@@ ch@@ -@@ led@@ ,” this under@@ states the universi@@ t@@ y’s histor@@ ic role in conver@@ ting the prim@@ ate H@@ om@@ o s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens into a cre@@ at@@ ure whose interest@@ s, as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions, and achiev@@ ements ex@@ tend beyond successful s@@ ex@@ ual re@@ produc@@ tion.
What was origin@@ ally called the “@@ liberal ar@@ ts@@ ” provided the skill@@ s necessary for this transform@@ ation.
By sub@@ mit@@ ting to a common regime of spe@@ ak@@ ing, w@@ rit@@ ing, read@@ ing, ob@@ serv@@ ing, and calcul@@ at@@ ing, the “@@ u@@ pri@@ ght ap@@ e” ac@@ qui@@ red the capacity to reason in public@@ .
This enab@@ led first him and then her to comm@@ and authority reg@@ ardless of bir@@ th, resulting in the for@@ ging of net@@ works and even institutions whose benefits cut deeply across blo@@ od@@ lin@@ es.
We too easily for@@ get that our he@@ ter@@ o@@ gene@@ ous societies rely on at least a w@@ ater@@ ed-@@ down ver@@ sion of this tra@@ ining to maintain political and economic order@@ .
The universi@@ ty began with the hum@@ ani@@ ties at its hear@@ t, but today it is pla@@ ying cat@@ ch@@ -@@ up with the natural sci@@ enc@@ es.
This is largely because the natural sci@@ ences have most clo@@ sely im@@ it@@ ated the productivity measures associated with indust@@ r@@ y.
The result is a “@@ big@@ ger is bet@@ ter@@ ” ment@@ ality that st@@ res@@ ses ever more public@@ ations, pat@@ ents, and c@@ it@@ ations.
Yet, this agenda ten@@ ds to be pursu@@ ed without much concern for how – or if – these measures fe@@ ed into something of greater soci@@ al, cul@@ tur@@ al, and even economic relev@@ ance.
The S@@ ci@@ ence C@@ it@@ ation In@@ de@@ x@@ , origin@@ ally designed to help resear@@ ch@@ ers disc@@ ern ag@@ greg@@ ate tren@@ ds in increasingly complex subject dom@@ ain@@ s sci@@ enc@@ es, has helped measure produc@@ tiv@@ ity.
But now these tren@@ ds are ro@@ ut@@ in@@ ely conver@@ ted into nor@@ ms against which the performance of particular universi@@ ties, de@@ part@@ ments, and even individual resear@@ ch@@ ers is jud@@ ge@@ d.
What is most easily measu@@ red has become conf@@ used with what is most worth meas@@ ur@@ ing.
But, more pro@@ found@@ ly, this entire line of thinking neg@@ lec@@ ts the distinc@@ tly transform@@ ative capacity of the knowledge in which the hum@@ ani@@ ties speci@@ aliz@@ es.
An adequate ass@@ ess@@ ment of this capacity requires looking at its multi@@ p@@ lier effec@@ ts.
As with John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Keyn@@ es@@ ’s no@@ tion that retur@@ ns on public investment must be measu@@ red as the long-term consequ@@ ence of other investments that it stimul@@ ates across the economy and societ@@ y, so, too, with the knowledge gener@@ ated by the hum@@ ani@@ ties.
This idea is lost in today’s cost accoun@@ ting for universi@@ ties, which treat@@ s what tran@@ spi@@ res between teach@@ er and stud@@ ent in the cl@@ ass@@ ro@@ om as ak@@ in to what happ@@ ens between produc@@ er and consumer in the market.
In both cas@@ es, it is assum@@ ed that the value of the ex@@ changed good is decided shor@@ tly after its deli@@ very according to how it sati@@ s@@ fi@@ es an immediate ne@@ ed.
Not surpri@@ sing@@ ly, students value their degree by the first job it ge@@ ts them rather than the life it prepar@@ es them for over the next hal@@ f-@@ century.
Today, it is hard to believe that in the he@@ y@@ day of the welfare state, universi@@ ties were both more eli@@ te and more public@@ ly f@@ unded than they are today.
B@@ ack then, it was assum@@ ed that the benefits of academ@@ ic tra@@ ining acc@@ ru@@ ed not on@@ ly, or even pri@@ mar@@ il@@ y, to those who experienc@@ ed it but al@@ so, and more importantly, to the rest of the popul@@ ation, whose lives were vari@@ ously en@@ rich@@ ed by the app@@ lic@@ ation of the ar@@ ts and sci@@ enc@@ es.
Of course, this en@@ rich@@ ment inclu@@ ded such prac@@ tical benefits as medical break@@ through@@ s and labor@@ -@@ saving technologi@@ es.
But the en@@ rich@@ ment provided by the hum@@ ani@@ ties was no less en@@ dur@@ ing, though its sub@@ t@@ ler nature makes it har@@ der to tra@@ ck@@ .
Nevertheless, to par@@ ap@@ h@@ ra@@ se Keyn@@ es, every time we turn on the radi@@ o or tel@@ evi@@ sion, re@@ ad a newspap@@ er, p@@ ick up a no@@ vel@@ , or wat@@ ch a mo@@ vi@@ e, we are in the th@@ r@@ all of one or more de@@ ad human@@ ists who set the terms of refer@@ ence through which we see the world.
In its long history as the pre@@ mi@@ er form of academ@@ ic know@@ led@@ ge, the hum@@ ani@@ ties were frequ@@ ently cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed for their sub@@ ver@@ sive charac@@ ter.
That some would now question whether the hum@@ ani@@ ties have any impact at all merely reflects the cru@@ de and short-@@ si@@ gh@@ ted way in which the value of academ@@ ic knowledge is measu@@ red and jud@@ ged today.
Perhaps that bef@@ its cre@@ at@@ ures whose lives are “@@ soli@@ tar@@ y, po@@ or, n@@ ast@@ y, bru@@ ti@@ sh@@ , and short@@ ,” to rec@@ all Th@@ om@@ as H@@ ob@@ bes@@ ’ descri@@ p@@ tion of the state of natu@@ re. But it does a gra@@ ve in@@ justice to those of us who still asp@@ ire to ful@@ l-@@ f@@ led@@ ged human@@ ity.
Why are the social sci@@ ences so much more at risk of having their budge@@ ts cut than the other two great bo@@ dies of academ@@ ic know@@ led@@ ge, the hum@@ ani@@ ties and the natural sci@@ enc@@ es?
For@@ mer British Prime Minister M@@ arg@@ ar@@ et That@@ cher no@@ tori@@ ously proposed that the fiel@@ d simply does not exist@@ : there is no such thing as societ@@ y, she claim@@ ed.
O@@ thers point to the restruc@@ turing of universi@@ ty social science de@@ part@@ ments.
But the expansion of business school@@ s argu@@ ably t@@ esti@@ fi@@ es to the continued vit@@ ality of the social sci@@ enc@@ es. 
Nor is it true that the social sci@@ ences bel@@ ab@@ or the ob@@ vi@@ ous, as is sometimes sa@@ i@@ d.
On the contrary, toda@@ y's com@@ mon@@ places were y@@ es@@ ter@@ da@@ y's innov@@ ations.
If you comp@@ are the conc@@ ep@@ ts used to fra@@ me newspap@@ er edi@@ tori@@ als today and ten or more years ago, you will find the deep - but un@@ acknow@@ led@@ ged - impact of the social sci@@ enc@@ es.
The influence may be re@@ gre@@ t@@ ted, but at least it is regi@@ ster@@ ed.
Still@@ , where are the social sci@@ ences in the vast con@@ vers@@ ation over "@@ human natu@@ re@@ " that has been pro@@ mp@@ ted by recent adv@@ ances in co@@ gni@@ tive ne@@ uro@@ sci@@ ence, behavi@@ or@@ al gene@@ tic@@ s, and ev@@ olu@@ tionary psych@@ olog@@ y?
Ch@@ ec@@ k out the el@@ abor@@ ate and inform@@ ative we@@ b@@ si@@ te (
 w@@ w@@ w@@ .@@ ed@@ ge@@ .@@ or@@ g
 ) de@@ voted to the promo@@ tion of a "@@ third cultu@@ re@@ " that brid@@ ges the hum@@ ani@@ ties and the natural sci@@ enc@@ es.
Social scientists are con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ous by their absen@@ ce. 
But what difference would their presence mak@@ e?
It is often assum@@ ed that everyone reco@@ il@@ s at the prospect that there are genetic limits to our capacity for change.
Ac@@ tu@@ ally, only those im@@ bu@@ ed with the optim@@ is@@ tic spiri@@ t of social science reco@@ il.
E@@ ver@@ y@@ one el@@ se is reli@@ ev@@ ed.
In the "@@ third cultu@@ re@@ " best s@@ eller 
 The B@@ lan@@ k S@@ lat@@ e: The Mo@@ dern Den@@ i@@ al of Hum@@ an Nat@@ ure
 , S@@ te@@ ven P@@ in@@ ker sa@@ ys that we may need to ad@@ mit a natural scientific basis for what human@@ ists have for cent@@ uri@@ es called "@@ f@@ at@@ e@@ ."
In other words, the conf@@ ig@@ u@@ ration of our bra@@ ins and gen@@ es may ultimately be out of our contro@@ l, ho@@ we@@ ver deeply we come to understand them.
P@@ in@@ k@@ er@@ 's message will appe@@ al to those e@@ ager to avoid political reforms that would compe@@ l a greater sense of collective responsi@@ bilit@@ y.
After all, the social sci@@ ences histor@@ ically offered emp@@ i@@ ri@@ cal support and spiri@@ tual hope for just such reform@@ s, which are increasingly dis@@ mis@@ sed as "@@ ut@@ op@@ i@@ an@@ ."
By contrast, the hum@@ ani@@ ties and the natural sci@@ ences share a sense of reality that tran@@ sc@@ ends time and plac@@ e; h@@ ence their common interest in a fix@@ ed "@@ human natu@@ re@@ ."
This is ti@@ ed to a way of thinking and a sense of know@@ ing that is largely con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ative and sometimes even dis@@ em@@ power@@ ing, as reality comes to seem to be whatever res@@ ists our conc@@ er@@ ted efforts at change.
These two great academ@@ ic cultu@@ res also pre@@ fer to study human@@ ity without having to m@@ ing@@ le with fl@@ es@@ h@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ blo@@ od human bein@@ g@@ s.
Thus, ev@@ olu@@ tionary psych@@ ologi@@ sts in@@ fer what makes us who we are from the remains of our St@@ one A@@ ge anc@@ est@@ ors (@@ including their D@@ NA@@ ), whereas human@@ ists focus on arti@@ fac@@ ts of a more recent and liter@@ ate age. 
In contrast, the social sci@@ ences ad@@ here to the ma@@ x@@ im that the best way to study hum@@ ans is to inter@@ act with them, typ@@ ically by getting them to do and say things that they might other@@ wise not.
This pro@@ found@@ ly simple ide@@ a, common to experi@@ ments and eth@@ no@@ graph@@ i@@ es, inspi@@ red the tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s and disa@@ st@@ ers that p@@ unc@@ tu@@ ate modern politics.
It requires an increasingly contro@@ versi@@ al assu@@ mp@@ tion@@ : all human bein@@ gs - whatever their achiev@@ em@@ ents, comp@@ et@@ enc@@ es, stat@@ us, or health - are equally significant members of societ@@ y, whose streng@@ th ultimately lies in what they can do toge@@ ther.
The social sci@@ enc@@ es@@ ' eg@@ alit@@ ari@@ an@@ ism r@@ uns coun@@ ter to both the human@@ ist fix@@ ation on eli@@ te "@@ classi@@ c@@ " tex@@ ts and the natural scientific tenden@@ cy to gener@@ alize across speci@@ es.
Thus, social scientists made the every@@ day lives of ordinary people respec@@ t@@ able, while ref@@ using to pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge certain anim@@ als over certain - typ@@ ically dis@@ ab@@ led or un@@ wanted - human@@ s.
"@@ Wel@@ f@@ are@@ " occup@@ ies a pri@@ de of place in the social sci@@ ences that human@@ ists and natural scientists re@@ place with "@@ survi@@ val@@ " and ma@@ y@@ be even "@@ fortun@@ e@@ ."
To be sure, the ch@@ eck@@ ered history of welfare in the 20
 th
 century put the future of the social sci@@ ences in dou@@ bt.
But a way forward can be found in T@@ . H@@ . Hu@@ x@@ le@@ y, Dar@@ win@@ 's f@@ ab@@ led public def@@ en@@ der.
A late conver@@ t to ev@@ olu@@ tion, he was a li@@ fel@@ ong skep@@ tic about the the@@ or@@ y's political implic@@ ations.
For Hu@@ x@@ le@@ y, civili@@ zed society ro@@ se above nature by its systemati@@ c resist@@ ance to natural sel@@ ec@@ tion.
In his words, the human condi@@ tion is not about "@@ survi@@ val of the f@@ it@@ test@@ " but "@@ the f@@ it@@ ting of as many as can survi@@ ve@@ ."
Hu@@ x@@ le@@ y identi@@ fied humanit@@ y's achiev@@ ements with legal conven@@ tions and medical technologi@@ es, arti@@ fi@@ ces that ex@@ tend human dom@@ ini@@ on by enab@@ ling people to be and do more than they could individu@@ ally.
The future of the social sci@@ ences may li@@ e in rek@@ in@@ d@@ ling this coalition of law and medic@@ ine and up@@ gra@@ ding the arti@@ fi@@ cial in a world that may have come to over@@ value natu@@ re.
W@@ ho@@ ever steps into Europe’s new top job as President of the European Council will set the m@@ ol@@ d.
If it is some@@ one of worldwide ren@@ ow@@ n, the presiden@@ cy will immedi@@ ately be established as a po@@ st of global import@@ ance.
But if its first occup@@ ant is not a household nam@@ e, the presiden@@ cy will be do@@ om@@ ed as just another of the European Uni@@ on’s conf@@ using p@@ le@@ th@@ or@@ a of wor@@ thy senior posi@@ tions that are neither valu@@ ed nor under@@ stood outside B@@ rus@@ sel@@ s.
The key point here is that Europe won@@ ’t be able to up@@ gra@@ de the job lat@@ er.
If the presiden@@ cy goes to a politici@@ an who lack@@ s f@@ ame and char@@ is@@ ma, its place will for@@ ever be low down in the international p@@ ec@@ king order@@ .
Of the hal@@ f-@@ do@@ zen candidates to become “@@ Europe’s Pres@@ id@@ ent@@ ,” only Tony Blair needs no introduc@@ tion any@@ wher@@ e.
All the other nam@@ es in the ring have to be ac@@ compani@@ ed by a descri@@ p@@ tion@@  @@ – the former F@@ inn@@ ish this or Au@@ stri@@ an th@@ at.
No@@ body knows whether the current prime ministers of the EU’s 2@@ 7 member countries will choose Bla@@ ir@@ .
There is consider@@ able ling@@ ering ill will over his role in the inv@@ asion of Iraq, and there is the in@@ conven@@ i@@ ent fact that he is from Euro@@ -@@ skep@@ tic Britain@@ , and that many on the left view him as a leader whose “@@ third way@@ ” was a betra@@ y@@ al of soci@@ alism.
But cho@@ os@@ ing a president for Europe is@@ n’t about Blair the man, or about the political rec@@ or@@ ds of any of@@  @@ the others who would like the job@@ .
It is about the job itself.
Europe’s problem is that it lack@@ s a clearly identi@@ fi@@ able leader@@ . As a result, despite the EU’s many success@@ es, it still spe@@ ak@@ s with too many vo@@ ic@@ es.
This was among the problems that the EU’s contro@@ versi@@ al Lis@@ bon treaty was designed to fix@@ .
It is now in the final st@@ ages of its long and difficult bir@@ th, and by the New Y@@ e@@ ar should be bringing new mechanis@@ ms to be@@ ar to stre@@ am@@ line European decision@@ -@@ mak@@ ing.
The je@@ we@@ l in its c@@ rown is to be the appoin@@ t@@ ment for a 3@@ 0-@@ month term of a ful@@ l-@@ time president of the European Counc@@ il, which groups the head@@ s of EU member government@@ s, along with a foreign policy ch@@ ief who will be backed by an em@@ br@@ y@@ on@@ ic EU diplomatic servic@@ e.
Now that more than two-@@ thir@@ ds of I@@ ris@@ h voters have re@@ vers@@ ed their country’s earlier opposition to the Lis@@ bon treaty – with only the C@@ ze@@ ch Republi@@ c@@ ’s Europ@@ ho@@ b@@ ic president, V@@ á@@ cla@@ v K@@ lau@@ s, holding out against it – the focus is on who will f@@ ill these two job@@ s.
And that, in tur@@ n, has trig@@ ger@@ ed a round of bit@@ ter political squ@@ ab@@ bl@@ ing that threat@@ ens to neg@@ ate the entire idea of a much more powerful European vo@@ ice on the global sta@@ ge.
The three Ben@@ el@@ u@@ x countries, along with a few other smaller EU nation@@ s, are op@@ posed to the new European president being from a large nation@@ .
And there are also those who fear that a political heav@@ y@@ wei@@ ght in the job might ec@@ li@@ p@@ se the EU Commission@@ ’s Pres@@ id@@ ent, former Portu@@ gu@@ ese prime minister J@@ os@@ é Man@@ u@@ el Bar@@ ro@@ so, who has just been con@@ firm@@ ed for a second fi@@ ve-@@ year ter@@ m, and de@@ value the role of the foreign policy ch@@ ief whose authority Lis@@ bon is due to be@@ ef up@@ .
These are speci@@ ous argum@@ ents.
The EU’s external relations invol@@ ve two different typ@@ es of politics.
The first is the politics of world the@@ at@@ re, where a political fig@@ ure of global stat@@ ure could do much to raise the EU’s prof@@ ile and ensure that it has a major say in re-@@ order@@ ing the post-@@ crisis global economic ru@@ le@@ book@@ .
The second is the politics of de@@ ta@@ il, where the new foreign policy chi@@ ef@@ ’s role is to create a single EU stance on the wide range of issues about which European governments still have wil@@ dly different national posi@@ tions.
Europe has an international ima@@ ge problem that in part st@@ em@@ s from a complex institutional structure that non-@@ EU countries find b@@ aff@@ l@@ ing.
It is over-@@ repres@@ ented at G-20 world sum@@ mit@@ s, for inst@@ ance, but the presence of four European national leader@@ s, pl@@ us EU represent@@ atives like Bar@@ ro@@ so, weak@@ ens rather than strength@@ ens its political wei@@ gh@@ t.
The same is true of other global bo@@ dies like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund@@ .
The result is that Europe’s achiev@@ ements in recent years – its expansion to create a single economic market of 500 million people and its creation of the euro as a currency that challenges the dollar – are not ac@@ compani@@ ed by a significantly greater global stand@@ ing.
World leaders from Barack Obama to Hu J@@ in@@ ta@@ o address themselves to Ber@@ lin@@ , Par@@ is, and Lond@@ on, rather than to B@@ rus@@ sel@@ s.
The result is that EU policy propos@@ als that could do much to adv@@ ance the economic and geo@@ political interests of Europeans are not as influ@@ ential as they could be.
The text of the Lis@@ bon treaty is stu@@ di@@ ously v@@ ague in its job descri@@ p@@ tion of the presid@@ ent@@ ’s role – an approach that prev@@ ented troub@@ le for treat@@ y’s fra@@ mer@@ s, but merely post@@ p@@ oned dis@@ agreem@@ ent.
The real argument now taking place between Europe’s national governments is about the authority that the EU’s president should ha@@ ve.
The risk is that Europe’s squ@@ ab@@ bl@@ ing politicians will op@@ t for a fig@@ u@@ re@@ head and mis@@ s this g@@ ol@@ den opportunity to create a global leader@@ .
T@@ I@@ L@@ B@@ U@@ R@@ G@@ , T@@ H@@ E NE@@ T@@ H@@ ER@@ L@@ AN@@ D@@ S – Two years ago, the leaders of the world’s central banks were considered her@@ o@@ es for their efforts in prev@@ enting financial crisis from tur@@ ning into Great Depression II@@ .
Today, however, central banks are being sharp@@ ly cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ z@@ ed, and their independence is coming under severe pressure in many countries, particularly in the euroz@@ one, as M@@ ari@@ o D@@ ra@@ gh@@ i, the head of the Bank of Ital@@ y, recently poin@@ ted out.
The type of person at the hel@@ m of any central bank is always important – but now more than ever@@ , because financial crises always thre@@ aten central bank@@ s’ indepen@@ dence.
In the United States, the Federal Reserve seems to have support only of the Obama administ@@ ration, hardly something of which to be pro@@ u@@ d.
Congress has di@@ spar@@ aged the F@@ ed@@ ’s handl@@ ing of the crisis, and Re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative R@@ on Paul of T@@ ex@@ as, who believ@@ es that the F@@ ed@@ ’s very exist@@ ence is un@@ constitu@@ tion@@ al, will take over one of the key con@@ gres@@ sion@@ al over@@ si@@ ght commit@@ te@@ es in Janu@@ ary.
More than half of all Americans want politicians to have more say over monetary policy – a sc@@ ary prospect in view of the historical rec@@ or@@ d.
Given the lik@@ eli@@ hood of a long period of sub@@ -@@ p@@ ar economic growth, increasing pressure on public finan@@ ces in the euroz@@ one, and the ongoing debate on the future of the euro@@ , the European Central Bank has be@@ come, more than ever befor@@ e, the last line of defense for Europe’s common curren@@ cy.
A fir@@ m ECB president, un@@ willing to yiel@@ d to political pres@@ sure, is nee@@ ded.
During the financial crisis, the ECB has had an out@@ standing president in the person of Je@@ an-@@ C@@ lau@@ de T@@ rich@@ et.
But his non-@@ renew@@ able term will end in Oc@@ tober 201@@ 1, and European leaders are not wa@@ iting until the last moment to ap@@ point his success@@ or.
Indeed, posi@@ tioning and bar@@ gain@@ ing among the euro@@ ’s member countries has already star@@ ted.
Fir@@ st and for@@ emo@@ st, the next ECB president should exc@@ el on monetary mat@@ ters.
Tru@@ e, the current financial crisis has brought bank super@@ vision to the for@@ e.
But monetary policy, not bank super@@ vi@@ sion, is the rais@@ on d@@ ’@@ ê@@ tr@@ e of central banks, whereas the banks can be well hand@@ led by the new@@ ly established European System@@ ic R@@ is@@ k Bo@@ ard (@@ ES@@ R@@ B@@ ), which will be responsible for macro@@ -@@ p@@ ru@@ denti@@ al super@@ vision in Europe from Janu@@ ary 1, 201@@ 1.
Fur@@ ther@@ mor@@ e, and contr@@ ary to common beli@@ ef@@ , the ECB president need not be very diplomati@@ c, but should be able to un@@ ite all members of the EC@@ B@@ ’s Govern@@ ing Counc@@ il.
As political pressure on central banks, including the EC@@ B@@ , increas@@ es, its president must not h@@ es@@ it@@ ate to cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ ze European politicians and, if necess@@ ary, public@@ ly name and sh@@ ame them.
The EC@@ B@@ ’s independence is its most valu@@ able asset – indeed, it is indi@@ sp@@ ensi@@ ble.
A good central bank@@ er must be able to say no to politici@@ ans.
This does not mean the ECB president should p@@ ick figh@@ ts wh@@ en@@ ever possible.
On the contrary, he should be able to build support for the EC@@ B@@ ’s indepen@@ dence.
But he should follow the ma@@ x@@ im about politicians set down by the EC@@ B@@ ’s first president, W@@ im D@@ u@@ isen@@ ber@@ g@@ : “@@ I can he@@ ar them, but I do not li@@ st@@ en@@ .”
The president should also coun@@ t on support from a majority of Europe@@ ans.
Unfortunately, country of orig@@ in is highly important in this respec@@ t.
Given the fact that the current ECB vic@@ e-@@ president is from southern Europe (@@ Portug@@ al@@ ), the next head of the ECB must come from nor@@ thern Europe.
Only some@@ one from Germany, the Ne@@ ther@@ land@@ s, or a S@@ c@@ and@@ in@@ avi@@ an euro country like Fin@@ land can coun@@ t on support from German@@ s, which is cru@@ ci@@ al.
There is certainly some@@ one to be found in the eurozone who pos@@ s@@ esses all these quali@@ ties.
In fact, there is more than one.
D@@ ra@@ gh@@ i is one. O@@ thers include Kl@@ aus Re@@ gl@@ ing, head of the European Financial Stability Fac@@ ili@@ ty (@@ E@@ FS@@ F@@ ), A@@ x@@ el We@@ ber, President of the Bundes@@ bank@@ , and J@@ ür@@ gen St@@ ark@@ , a current member of the EC@@ B@@ ’s Ex@@ ecu@@ tive Bo@@ ar@@ d.
D@@ ra@@ gh@@ i@@ ’s Itali@@ an pas@@ sp@@ ort and his past service at Gold@@ man Sach@@ s do not help him mu@@ ch.
Re@@ gl@@ ing has a lot of experi@@ ence, but n@@ one in central banking and monetary policy.
An@@ y@@ one who wants St@@ ar@@ k will need a good te@@ am of law@@ y@@ ers to fig@@ ure out how to conver@@ t his curr@@ ent, non-@@ renew@@ able appoin@@ t@@ ment on the Ex@@ ecu@@ tive Bo@@ ard into an appoin@@ t@@ ment as President without viol@@ ating the EC@@ B@@ ’s rul@@ es.
Given some of We@@ ber@@ ’s stat@@ ements over 201@@ 0, he could be acc@@ used of being much too un@@ diplomati@@ c.
N@@ out W@@ ell@@ in@@ k, currently the head of the D@@ ut@@ ch central bank@@ , is a wil@@ d@@ car@@ d candid@@ ate, as is Er@@ k@@ k@@ i Li@@ i@@ kan@@ en of the Fin@@ ish central bank@@ .
Both are su@@ it@@ able for the po@@ st.
The final deci@@ sion, of course, res@@ ts with European head@@ s of state and government.
But, in our view, T@@ rich@@ et@@ ’s success@@ or will most likely answer to the name of We@@ ber, W@@ ell@@ in@@ k, or Li@@ i@@ kan@@ en.
A few months ago, E@@ vo Mor@@ ales became Bolivi@@ a@@ ‘@@ s first democrati@@ cally elected indi@@ gen@@ ous head of state.
Indi@@ gen@@ ous groups constitu@@ te 6@@ 2% of Bolivi@@ a’s popul@@ ation, and those with mi@@ x@@ ed blo@@ od another 30@@ %, but for 500 years Bolivi@@ ans had been rul@@ ed by col@@ oni@@ al powers and their des@@ c@@ end@@ ant@@ s.
Wel@@ l into the twenti@@ eth century, indi@@ gen@@ ous groups were effectively de@@ priv@@ ed of a vote and a vo@@ ic@@ e.
A@@ y@@ mar@@ a and Qu@@ ech@@ u@@ a, their langu@@ ag@@ es, were not even recognized for conduc@@ ting public bus@@ ines@@ s.
So Mor@@ al@@ es’ election was histor@@ ic@@ , and the exc@@ it@@ ement in Boli@@ via is pal@@ p@@ able.
But Mor@@ al@@ es’ nation@@ alization of Bolivi@@ a’s oil and gas fiel@@ ds sent sho@@ ck wa@@ ves through the international commun@@ ity.
During his campaig@@ n, Mor@@ ales made clear his inten@@ tion to increase state control over national gas and o@@ il.
But he had made it equally clear that he did not inten@@ d to ex@@ pro@@ pri@@ ate the property of energy firms – he wanted foreign investors to sta@@ y.
(@@ Nation@@ alization does not, of course, necess@@ arily mean ex@@ pro@@ pri@@ ation without appropriate compens@@ ation@@ .)
Perhaps surpri@@ sing for modern politici@@ ans, Mor@@ ales took his wor@@ ds seri@@ ous@@ ly.
Gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely concerned about raising the in@@ comes of his des@@ per@@ ately poor people, he recognized that Boli@@ via needs for@@ eig@@ ner@@ s’ exper@@ ti@@ se to achieve growth, and that this ent@@ ail@@ s pa@@ ying fair@@ ly for their servic@@ es.
But are foreign ow@@ ners getting more than a fair rate of retur@@ n@@ ?
Mor@@ al@@ es’ actions are widely supported by Bolivi@@ ans, who see the so-called privati@@ z@@ ations (or “@@ capit@@ aliz@@ ations@@ ”@@ ) under former President G@@ on@@ z@@ al@@ o “@@ G@@ oni@@ ” S@@ an@@ che@@ z de L@@ oz@@ ada as a ri@@ p@@ -@@ off@@ : Boli@@ via received only 18@@ % of the proc@@ e@@ ed@@ s@@ !
Bolivi@@ ans won@@ der why investments of some $@@ 3 billion should enti@@ t@@ le foreign investors to 8@@ 2% of the country’s vast gas reser@@ ves, now estimated to be worth $@@ 2@@ 50 billi@@ on.
While there has not yet been full disc@@ los@@ ure of retur@@ n@@ s, or an au@@ di@@ t of the true value of invest@@ ments, it appears that investors w@@ oul@@ d, at the old term@@ s, have rec@@ ou@@ p@@ ed all their money within just four years.
Bolivi@@ ans also ask why foreign@@ ers rea@@ p all the benefits of today’s high prices for oil and gas@@ ?
It costs no more to ex@@ trac@@ t oil or gas today than it did when prices were one-@@ third of their current level@@ .
Yet, the foreign oil companies get 8@@ 2% of the increase – in the case of o@@ il, this would amount to a win@@ d@@ fall for them of $@@ 3@@ 2 a bar@@ re@@ l or more.
No won@@ der that Bolivi@@ ans thought they were being che@@ ated and de@@ man@@ ded a new de@@ al.
On Ma@@ y 2, Mor@@ ales simply re@@ vers@@ ed the percent@@ ag@@ es, p@@ ending rene@@ goti@@ ation of the contrac@@ ts@@ : the companies oper@@ ating in the two largest fiel@@ ds would get 18@@ % of the production for themsel@@ ves.
As part of this new de@@ al, Boli@@ via should also get a larger share when prices increas@@ e.
(@@ Boli@@ via ma@@ y, of course, not want to be@@ ar the risk of a fall in the pri@@ ce, so it may stri@@ ke a deal to trans@@ fer some of the down@@ side risk to foreign compani@@ es, giving them in exchange more of the up@@ side poten@@ ti@@ al@@ .)
To most Bolivi@@ ans, what is at st@@ ake is a matter of fair@@ n@@ ess@@ : Sh@@ ould foreign oil and gas companies get a fair return on their capit@@ al, or a super@@ normal retur@@ n@@ ?
Sh@@ ould Boli@@ via be paid a fair value for its resourc@@ es?
And should Bolivi@@ a, or foreign compani@@ es, rea@@ p most of the win@@ d@@ fall gains from increases in energy pric@@ es?
Moreover, many de@@ als were appar@@ ently done in secre@@ t by previous governments – and appar@@ ently without the appro@@ val of Con@@ gres@@ s.
Indeed, because Bolivi@@ a’s Constitu@@ tion requires the appro@@ val of Congress for such sal@@ es, it is@@ n’t clear that Mor@@ ales is nation@@ aliz@@ ing any@@ th@@ ing@@ : the assets were never proper@@ ly sol@@ d.
When a country is ro@@ b@@ bed of a national art tre@@ as@@ u@@ re, we don’t call its return “@@ re-@@ nation@@ aliz@@ ation@@ ,” because it bel@@ on@@ ged to the country all al@@ on@@ g.
As with many privati@@ z@@ ations elsewher@@ e, there are questions as to whether the foreign investors have kept their side of the bar@@ gain@@ .
Boli@@ via contribut@@ ed to these jo@@ int enterpri@@ ses not only with resourc@@ es, but also with previous invest@@ ments.
The foreign compani@@ es’ contribu@@ tion was supposed to be further invest@@ ment.
But did they fully live up to their commit@@ ment@@ s?
Ar@@ e accoun@@ ting gi@@ mm@@ i@@ cks being used to over@@ state the true value of foreign capital contribu@@ tions@@ ?
Bolivi@@ a’s government h@@ as, so f@@ ar, simply raised ques@@ tions, and set in mo@@ tion a process for as@@ certain@@ ing the answer@@ .
The problem in Boli@@ via is a lack of transpar@@ enc@@ y, both when contrac@@ ts are signed and after@@ war@@ ds.
Without transpar@@ enc@@ y, it is easy for citizens to feel that they are being che@@ ated – and they often ar@@ e.
When foreign companies get a deal that is too good to be tru@@ e, there is often something under@@ han@@ ded going on.
A@@ round the world, oil and gas companies have themselves to blam@@ e: too of@@ ten, they have resist@@ ed calls for greater transpar@@ enc@@ y.
In the futu@@ re, companies and countries should agree on a simple princip@@ le@@ : there should be, to par@@ ap@@ h@@ ra@@ se President Wo@@ od@@ row Wil@@ son@@ ’s mem@@ or@@ able words, “@@ open contrac@@ ts, open@@ ly and transpar@@ ently ar@@ ri@@ ved at@@ .”
If the Bolivi@@ ans do not get fair value for their country’s natural weal@@ th, their prospec@@ ts are ble@@ ak@@ .
Even if they do@@ , they will need assi@@ st@@ ance, not only to ex@@ trac@@ t their resourc@@ es, but also to improve the health and education of all Bolivi@@ ans – to ensure long-term economic growth and social wel@@ far@@ e.
For now, the world should cel@@ eb@@ rate the fact that Boli@@ via has a democrati@@ cally elected leader attemp@@ ting to repres@@ ent the interests of the poor people of his country.
It is a histor@@ ic mom@@ ent.
Fi@@ f@@ ty years ago, American chi@@ cken farm@@ ers found that by ke@@ eping their bir@@ ds in sh@@ eds they could produce chi@@ ck@@ ens for the table more che@@ ap@@ ly and with less work than by traditional farm@@ y@@ ard metho@@ ds.
The new metho@@ d spread@@ : chi@@ ck@@ ens dis@@ appe@@ ared from fiel@@ ds into lon@@ g, win@@ dow@@ less sh@@ ed@@ s.
Fac@@ tory farm@@ ing was bor@@ n.
It is@@ n’t called “@@ fac@@ tory farm@@ ing@@ ” merely because those sh@@ eds look like fac@@ tori@@ es.
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing about the production metho@@ d is ge@@ ared towards tur@@ ning live anim@@ als into mach@@ ines for conver@@ ting gra@@ in into me@@ at or eg@@ gs at the low@@ est possible co@@ st.
W@@ al@@ k into such a shed – if the produc@@ er will let you – and you will find up to 30@@ ,000 chi@@ ck@@ ens.
The National Chi@@ cken Counc@@ il, the trade associ@@ ation for the US chi@@ cken indust@@ ry, re@@ commen@@ ds a stock@@ ing den@@ si@@ ty of 8@@ 5 squ@@ are in@@ ches per bir@@ d – less than a standard she@@ et of typ@@ ing pap@@ er.
When the chi@@ ck@@ ens approach market wei@@ gh@@ t, they cover the flo@@ or comple@@ tel@@ y.
No chi@@ cken can move without having to push through other bir@@ ds.
In the eg@@ g indust@@ ry, h@@ ens can bar@@ ely move at all, because they are cra@@ mm@@ ed into wir@@ e c@@ ag@@ es, which makes it possible to st@@ ack them in tier@@ s, one above the other.
En@@ viron@@ ment@@ alists point out that this production metho@@ d is un@@ sustain@@ able.
For a star@@ t, it reli@@ es on the use of fossi@@ l fuel energy to light and ven@@ ti@@ late the sh@@ ed@@ s, and to tran@@ sp@@ ort the gra@@ in e@@ aten by the chi@@ ck@@ ens.
When this gra@@ in, which hum@@ ans could e@@ at direc@@ t@@ ly, is f@@ ed to chi@@ ck@@ ens, they use some of it to create b@@ ones and fe@@ ath@@ ers and other body parts that we cannot e@@ at.
So we get less food back than we put into the bir@@ ds – and less pro@@ t@@ ein, too – while dis@@ posing of the concent@@ rated chi@@ cken man@@ ure causes serious poll@@ u@@ tion to ri@@ vers and ground wat@@ er.
A@@ ni@@ m@@ al-@@ welfare advoc@@ ates pro@@ test that c@@ row@@ ding the chi@@ ck@@ ens ke@@ ep@@ s them from form@@ ing a natural f@@ lock@@ , causes them st@@ res@@ s, and, in the case of la@@ ying h@@ ens, prev@@ ents them from even stre@@ t@@ ching their w@@ ings.
The air in the sh@@ eds is high in am@@ mon@@ ia from bir@@ d f@@ ec@@ es, which are usually allowed to p@@ ile up for months – and in some cases for a year or more – before being cle@@ an@@ ed out.
Medi@@ cal exper@@ ts war@@ n that because the bir@@ ds are ro@@ ut@@ in@@ ely f@@ ed anti@@ bio@@ tics to keep them growing in such c@@ row@@ ded, fil@@ th@@ y, and st@@ res@@ s@@ ful condi@@ tions, anti@@ bio@@ tic@@ -@@ resist@@ ant b@@ ac@@ ter@@ ia could cause a public-@@ health threat@@ .
Yet, despite these well-@@ fo@@ unded critic@@ ism@@ s, over the last 20 years fac@@ tory farm@@ ing – not only of chi@@ ck@@ ens, but also of p@@ ig@@ s, ve@@ al cal@@ ves, da@@ ir@@ y co@@ w@@ s, and, in out@@ do@@ or fe@@ ed@@ lo@@ ts, c@@ att@@ le – has spread rapidly in developing countries, especially in Asi@@ a.
Now we are dis@@ cover@@ ing that the consequences may be far more de@@ adly than we ever imag@@ in@@ ed.
As University of O@@ t@@ ta@@ wa vi@@ ro@@ log@@ ist E@@ ar@@ l B@@ rown put it after a Can@@ adi@@ an out@@ break of avi@@ an influ@@ enz@@ a, “@@ high-@@ intensi@@ ty chi@@ cken re@@ aring is a perf@@ ect environment for gener@@ ating vi@@ rul@@ ent avi@@ an fl@@ u vi@@ rus@@ es@@ .”
Other exper@@ ts agre@@ e.
In Oc@@ tober 200@@ 5, a United Nations task force identi@@ fied as one of the ro@@ ot causes of the bir@@ d fl@@ u epi@@ dem@@ ic@@ , “@@ farm@@ ing metho@@ ds which c@@ row@@ d huge numbers of anim@@ als into small sp@@ ac@@ es@@ .”
S@@ up@@ por@@ ters of fac@@ tory farm@@ ing often point out that bir@@ d fl@@ u can be spread by fre@@ e-@@ range f@@ lock@@ s, or by wi@@ ld du@@ cks and other mig@@ rating bir@@ ds, who may join the fre@@ e-@@ range bir@@ ds to fe@@ ed with them or dro@@ p their f@@ ec@@ es while fl@@ ying over@@ head@@ .
But, as B@@ rown has poin@@ ted out, vi@@ rus@@ es found in wi@@ ld bir@@ ds are generally not very danger@@ ous.
On the contrary, it is only when these vi@@ rus@@ es enter a high-@@ den@@ si@@ ty p@@ oul@@ try operation that they mut@@ ate into something far more vi@@ rul@@ ent.
By contrast, bir@@ ds that are re@@ ared by traditional metho@@ ds are likely to have greater resist@@ ance to disease than the st@@ res@@ s@@ ed, gene@@ tic@@ ally similar bir@@ ds kept in inten@@ sive con@@ fin@@ ement system@@ s.
Moreover, fac@@ tory far@@ ms are not bi@@ ologi@@ cally secu@@ re. They are frequ@@ ently in@@ fest@@ ed with m@@ ic@@ e, rat@@ s, and other anim@@ als that can bring in diseas@@ es.
So f@@ ar, a relatively small number of human bein@@ gs have died from the current stra@@ in of avi@@ an influ@@ enz@@ a, and it appears that they have all been in con@@ t@@ act with infec@@ ted bir@@ ds.
But if the vi@@ ru@@ s mut@@ ates into a form that is trans@@ missi@@ ble between hum@@ ans, the number of death@@ s could run into the hundreds of milli@@ on@@ s.
Govern@@ ments are, righ@@ t@@ ly, taking action to pre@@ p@@ are for this threat@@ .
Rec@@ ently, the US Sen@@ ate appro@@ ved spending $@@ 8 billion to stock@@ p@@ ile v@@ acc@@ ines and other dru@@ gs to help prevent a possible bir@@ d fl@@ u epi@@ dem@@ ic@@ .
Other governments have already spent tens of millions on v@@ acc@@ ines and other pre@@ ven@@ tive meas@@ ur@@ es.
What is now cle@@ ar, however, is that such government spending is really a kind of sub@@ sid@@ y to the p@@ oul@@ try indust@@ r@@ y.
Like most subsi@@ dies, it is bad economic@@ s.
Fac@@ tory farm@@ ing spread because it seemed to be che@@ ap@@ er than more traditional metho@@ ds.
In fact, it was che@@ ap@@ er only because it pass@@ ed some of its costs on to others – for example, to people who li@@ ved down@@ stre@@ am or down@@ win@@ d from the fac@@ tory farm@@ s, and could no longer enjo@@ y cle@@ an water and air@@ .
Now we see that these were only a small part of the total cost@@ s.
Fac@@ tory farm@@ ing is pass@@ ing far big@@ ger costs – and risks – on to all of us.
In economic term@@ s, these costs should be “@@ intern@@ aliz@@ ed@@ ” by the fac@@ tory farm@@ ers rather than being shif@@ ted on@@ to the rest of us.
That won@@ ’t be easy to do@@ , but we could make a start by im@@ posing a tax on factor@@ y-@@ far@@ m products until enough reven@@ ue is raised to pay for the prec@@ au@@ tions that governments now have to take against avi@@ an influ@@ enz@@ a.
Th@@ en we might finally see that chi@@ cken from the fac@@ tory far@@ m really is@@ n’t so che@@ ap after all.
No one is in@@ different to Al J@@ az@@ e@@ er@@ a, the Q@@ at@@ ari@@ -@@ based Arab sat@@ el@@ li@@ te tel@@ evi@@ sion st@@ ation.
Yo@@ u can practic@@ ally see the blo@@ od of US officials bo@@ il when they disc@@ uss it.
To be sure, in the con@@ text of the dre@@ am of all Ara@@ bs being un@@ ited and independent of foreign contro@@ l, Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era is unden@@ i@@ ably par@@ tial to Arab as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions. But that does not make its news repor@@ ting un@@ tru@@ th@@ ful@@ .
In fact, Al J@@ az@@ e@@ er@@ a, which US Secretary of State C@@ oli@@ n Po@@ well calls "@@ hor@@ ri@@ ble@@ " and "@@ s@@ lan@@ ted@@ ," is a pi@@ vo@@ tal v@@ eh@@ ic@@ le for reform and change, which genu@@ in@@ ely democratic Arab activi@@ sts and the international community ali@@ ke have been call@@ ing for@@ .
So inc@@ ens@@ ed has America be@@ en, however, that it created its own Arab@@ ic langu@@ age m@@ ou@@ th@@ pi@@ ec@@ e in the form of sat@@ el@@ li@@ te st@@ ation Al H@@ ur@@ ra@@ .
Yet Al H@@ ur@@ ra is for@@ b@@ id@@ den from bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast@@ ing within the US, because it is state contro@@ l@@ led.
Ara@@ bs don@@ 't trust it, ei@@ ther.
It demonstrat@@ ed its l@@ ap@@ do@@ g status by never bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast@@ ing ima@@ ges of prison@@ ers being ab@@ used in@@ side B@@ ag@@ h@@ d@@ ad@@ 's no@@ tori@@ ous Ab@@ u G@@ h@@ ra@@ i@@ b prison@@ .
In this respec@@ t, at lea@@ st, Al H@@ ur@@ ra f@@ its perf@@ ec@@ tly within the t@@ ame tradi@@ tion of Arab state bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast@@ ers.
America, however, is not alone in challeng@@ ing Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era head on.
The B@@ B@@ C@@ , which bri@@ ef@@ ly ra@@ n its own Arab@@ ic langu@@ age news st@@ ation in the mid-@@ 1990@@ 's - before clos@@ ing it down because its Saudi f@@ under@@ s were un@@ happ@@ y with its repor@@ ting - recently announced that it will re-@@ laun@@ ch an Arab@@ ic langu@@ age news sat@@ el@@ li@@ te st@@ ation.
But instead of bas@@ h@@ ing or seeking to undermin@@ e Al J@@ az@@ e@@ er@@ a, politicians should encourage this bas@@ tion of free ex@@ pres@@ sion, recogni@@ zing that Ara@@ bs will need to en@@ dur@@ e a mess@@ y process on the way to democracy.
Al@@ ong that tor@@ tu@@ ous rou@@ te, the world's major powers are bound to be offen@@ ded, probably quite regul@@ ar@@ ly.
T@@ el@@ evi@@ sion in the Arab world has for years been the m@@ ou@@ th@@ pi@@ ec@@ e used by ruling presid@@ ents, k@@ ings, and em@@ ir@@ s to pro@@ pag@@ ate their official opini@@ ons and nothing el@@ se.
Eli@@ te military un@@ its usually protect radi@@ o and tel@@ evi@@ sion st@@ ations, because they have often been the first targe@@ ts in military cou@@ p@@ s.
Given this history, and the stor@@ m of calls for reform in the Arab world, it is a tra@@ gi@@ c ir@@ ony that America and the West have paid so little attention to the ter@@ res@@ tri@@ al Arab mon@@ opol@@ y tel@@ evi@@ sion chan@@ n@@ el@@ s.
Indeed, US critic@@ ism of Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era so@@ und@@ s more like special p@@ leading because of America's in@@ ept b@@ um@@ bl@@ ing in Iraq than a genu@@ ine desire for fre@@ e, op@@ en, and critical Arab medi@@ a.
If democracy means giving people a free choic@@ e, then there is no doubt that the choice of most Ara@@ bs is for a tel@@ evi@@ sion bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast@@ er that reflects their as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions.
In this sen@@ se, Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era is clearly bi@@ as@@ ed, because it is run by Arab pat@@ rio@@ ts and reflects Arab senti@@ ment.
But this is no more a cri@@ me than the fact that America's media reflects American as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions, and in times of war beha@@ ves like a che@@ er@@ leader for US forc@@ es.
The key issue here is whether Al J@@ az@@ e@@ er@@ a, as well as American T@@ V st@@ ations, are tru@@ th@@ ful in what they sa@@ y.
Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era is certainly profession@@ al.
Its leading journ@@ alists are Wes@@ tern@@ -@@ tra@@ in@@ ed, many having worked for years at the B@@ B@@ C@@ .
In fact, Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era was fo@@ unded only after the B@@ B@@ C clos@@ ed its Arab@@ ic langu@@ age st@@ ation under Saudi pressu@@ re.
Al J@@ az@@ e@@ er@@ a's mo@@ tto@@ , "@@ opinion and op@@ posing opini@@ on@@ ," has g@@ al@@ v@@ ani@@ zed Arab vie@@ wer@@ s, because cl@@ ash@@ ing opini@@ ons are r@@ ar@@ ely hear@@ d on ter@@ res@@ tri@@ al Arab tel@@ evi@@ sion st@@ ations.
Of course, when cover@@ ing the Israeli occup@@ ation of Palest@@ ine and the US-@@ led war on Iraq, Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era has not been objec@@ tive.
How could it be@@ ?
But it did not make up fac@@ ts@@ ; it merely reflec@@ ted majority Arab opini@@ on.
On such fundamental issues of Arab consen@@ s@@ us, it is simply il@@ logi@@ cal to expect an Arab bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast@@ er to be ev@@ en-@@ han@@ ded.
Moreover, Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era has not been d@@ um@@ b to comp@@ la@@ in@@ ts about it.
In Jul@@ y, Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era became the first Arab T@@ V st@@ ation to create a profession@@ al co@@ de of eth@@ ic@@ s.
According to the B@@ B@@ C@@ , the co@@ de defin@@ es with absolu@@ te cl@@ arity and transpar@@ ency how Al-@@ J@@ az@@ e@@ era journ@@ alists are to beha@@ ve, and s@@ ets clear divi@@ sions between new@@ s, analysi@@ s, and com@@ ment@@ ary.
As for Al J@@ az@@ e@@ er@@ a's journ@@ alisti@@ c performan@@ ce, it is past time that the st@@ ation be jud@@ ged by respec@@ ted profession@@ al journ@@ ali@@ sts, not by US or other officials with a policy a@@ x@@ e to gr@@ in@@ d.
A major universi@@ ty de@@ part@@ ment of journ@@ alism working with Arab media critic@@ s, for example, could provide a much more hon@@ est analysi@@ s of the st@@ ation@@ 's work.
If Americ@@ an, Briti@@ sh@@ , and other Western officials are serious about reform in the Arab world, they must support reform@@ -@@ min@@ ded Arab individuals and organiz@@ ations, even if those organizations make them un@@ com@@ for@@ table at tim@@ es.
If that becomes the West@@ 's stand@@ ar@@ d, Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era will righ@@ tly be seen as part of the solu@@ tion, not part of the problem.
CO@@ P@@ EN@@ HA@@ G@@ E@@ N – I@@ mag@@ ine that over the next 70 or 8@@ 0 years, a gi@@ ant port city – say, T@@ ok@@ y@@ o – found itself eng@@ ul@@ f@@ ed by se@@ a levels rising as much as 15 fe@@ et or more.
Milli@@ ons of in@@ hab@@ it@@ ants would be imperi@@ le@@ d, along with trilli@@ ons of dollars worth of infrastructu@@ re.
This aw@@ ful prospect is exac@@ tly the sort of thing glob@@ al-@@ warming ev@@ ange@@ li@@ sts like Al Gor@@ e have in min@@ d when they war@@ n that we must take “@@ lar@@ ge-@@ sc@@ al@@ e, pre@@ ven@@ tive measures to protect human civili@@ zation as we know it@@ .”
The rhetor@@ ic may sound extre@@ me, but with so much h@@ ang@@ ing in the bal@@ ance, su@@ rely it@@ ’s justi@@ fi@@ ed.
Without a v@@ ast@@ , highly coordin@@ ated global effor@@ t, how could we possibly co@@ pe with se@@ a-@@ level ris@@ es on that order of mag@@ nit@@ u@@ de@@ ?
W@@ ell, we already ha@@ ve. In fact, we@@ ’@@ re doing it right now.
Since 193@@ 0, excessive ground@@ water withdraw@@ al has caused T@@ ok@@ y@@ o to sub@@ side by as much as 15 fe@@ et, with some of the low@@ est parts of the down@@ to@@ w@@ n area dro@@ pp@@ ing almost a fo@@ ot per year in some years.
Simil@@ ar subsi@@ dence has occur@@ red over the past century in a wide range of ci@@ ties, including Ti@@ an@@ j@@ in, Sh@@ ang@@ ha@@ i, Os@@ ak@@ a, Bang@@ k@@ ok@@ , and J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta@@ .
In each case, the city has managed to protect itself from such large se@@ a-@@ level ris@@ es and th@@ ri@@ ve.
The point is@@ n’t that we can or should ignor@@ e global warm@@ ing.
The point is that we should be war@@ y of hy@@ per@@ bo@@ li@@ c predic@@ tions.
More often than not, what sound like hor@@ ri@@ fic changes in climate and geo@@ graph@@ y actually turn out to be manage@@ able – and in some cases even ben@@ ig@@ n.
Consi@@ der, for example, the fin@@ d@@ ings of climate scientists Robert J@@ . Nich@@ oll@@ s, Rich@@ ard S@@ .@@ J@@ . T@@ ol@@ , and A@@ th@@ an@@ asi@@ os T@@ . V@@ af@@ ei@@ di@@ s.
In research f@@ unded by the European Union, they stu@@ died what the global economic impact would be if global warming were to result in a collapse of the entire West An@@ tar@@ c@@ tic I@@ ce S@@ he@@ et.
An ev@@ ent of this mag@@ nit@@ u@@ de would likely cause the oc@@ e@@ ans to rise by perhaps 20 fe@@ et over the next hund@@ red years – precisely the sort of thing that environmental activi@@ sts have in min@@ d when they war@@ n about potential end@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ th@@ e-@@ world cal@@ am@@ i@@ ties.
But would it really be all that cal@@ am@@ it@@ ous@@ ?
Not according to Nich@@ oll@@ s, T@@ ol@@ , and V@@ af@@ ei@@ di@@ s.
H@@ ere are the fac@@ ts.
A 20-@@ fo@@ ot rise in se@@ a levels (@@ wh@@ ich, not inci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally, is about ten times more than the United Nations climate pan@@ el@@ ’s wor@@ st-@@ case expect@@ ations@@ ) would in@@ und@@ ate about 16@@ ,000 squ@@ are mil@@ es of co@@ ast@@ lin@@ e, where more than 4@@ 00 million people currently li@@ ve.
That@@ ’s a lot of people, to be sure, but hardly all of man@@ kin@@ d.
In fact, it amoun@@ ts to less than 6% of the world’s population – which is to say that 9@@ 4% of the population would not be in@@ und@@ ated.
And most of those who do live in the flo@@ od areas would never even get their fe@@ et w@@ et.
That@@ ’s because the vast majority of those 4@@ 00 million people res@@ ide within ci@@ ties, where they could be protec@@ ted relatively easi@@ ly, as in T@@ ok@@ yo@@ .
As a result, only about 15 million people would have to be re@@ loc@@ ated.
And that is over the course of a century.
In all, according to Nich@@ oll@@ s, T@@ ol@@ , and V@@ af@@ ei@@ di@@ s, the total cost of man@@ aging this “@@ c@@ atastrop@@ he@@ ” – if politicians do not di@@ ther and pursue sm@@ ar@@ t, coordin@@ ated policies – would be about $@@ 6@@ 00 billion a year, or less than 1% of global GDP.
This fig@@ ure may seem surpri@@ s@@ ingly low@@ , but that is only because so many of us have accepted the widespread view that we lack the capacity to adap@@ t to large ris@@ es in se@@ a level@@ s.
Not only do we have this capac@@ ity, but we have demonstrat@@ ed it many times in the past@@ .
Like it or not, global warming is re@@ al, it is man@@ -@@ ma@@ de, and we need to do something about it.
But we are not facing the end of the world.
C@@ lim@@ ate science is a sub@@ t@@ le and fi@@ endi@@ sh@@ ly con@@ vol@@ uted discipl@@ ine that r@@ ar@@ ely yiel@@ ds un@@ am@@ big@@ u@@ ous forec@@ ast@@ s or stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions.
And after 20 years of much talk but preci@@ ous little action on global warm@@ ing, a certain amount of fru@@ stration is to be expec@@ ted.
There is an understand@@ able desire to want to cut through the ver@@ bi@@ age and sh@@ ake people by the sh@@ oul@@ der@@ s.
Unfortunately, trying to sc@@ are the so@@ cks off of people do@@ es@@ n’t help mat@@ ters.
Y@@ es, a star@@ tl@@ ing statisti@@ c, combined with some hy@@ per@@ bo@@ li@@ c pro@@ se, will make us si@@ t up and pay atten@@ tion.
But we quickly become des@@ ensi@@ tiz@@ ed, requ@@ iring ever more ou@@ tra@@ ge@@ ous scenari@@ os to move us.
As the sc@@ are st@@ ories become more infl@@ ated, so, too, does the lik@@ eli@@ hood that they will be ex@@ posed for the ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ations that they are – and the public will end up tun@@ ing the whole thing out.
This may explain recent poll@@ ing data show@@ ing that public concern about global warming has decl@@ ined pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ously in the last three years.
In the United States, for example, the Pe@@ w Institu@@ te repor@@ ted that the number of Americans who regard global warming as a very serious problem had decl@@ ined from 4@@ 4% in April 2008 to only 3@@ 5% last Oc@@ to@@ ber@@ .
More rec@@ ently, a B@@ B@@ C study found that only 2@@ 6% of B@@ rit@@ ons believe that man@@ -@@ made “@@ climate change is happ@@ en@@ ing@@ ,” down from 4@@ 1% in November 200@@ 9.
And in Germany, Der Sp@@ ie@@ gel ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine repor@@ ted surv@@ ey results show@@ ing that only 4@@ 2% fear@@ ed global warm@@ ing, compared with 6@@ 2% in 200@@ 6.
F@@ e@@ ar may be a great mo@@ tiv@@ ator in the short ter@@ m, but it is a terri@@ ble basis for making sm@@ art decisions about a complic@@ ated problem that demands our full intel@@ ligence for a long peri@@ od.
S@@ O@@ F@@ I@@ A – At a time when the ongoing European debt crisis is fra@@ c@@ turing public fa@@ ith in the contin@@ ent@@ ’s political and economic institutions, one would expect Europe’s leaders to strengthen as many uni@@ fying sym@@ bol@@ s as they can@@ .
Instead, they have allowed one of the je@@ wel@@ s of post-@@ World War II European integration – the European Court of Hum@@ an R@@ igh@@ ts (@@ EC@@ H@@ R@@ ) – to come under threat as well.
Un@@ like the B@@ rus@@ sel@@ s-@@ based European Union, long bel@@ e@@ agu@@ ered by its democratic defic@@ it, the Stra@@ s@@ bo@@ ur@@ g-@@ based EC@@ H@@ R is, if any@@ th@@ ing, too well lo@@ v@@ ed.
In 201@@ 1, more than 60@@ ,000 people sought its help – far more than can expect a reason@@ ed deci@@ sion.
(@@ By contrast, the United States Su@@ pre@@ me Court recei@@ ves roughly 10@@ ,000 pe@@ ti@@ tions a year@@ .)
To save the EC@@ H@@ R from this c@@ rus@@ h@@ ing bur@@ den, some member states have proposed changes that could weak@@ en it, even if un@@ inten@@ tion@@ ally.
Those of us who pas@@ sion@@ ately believe in the Court and its achiev@@ ements must spe@@ ak out now to persu@@ ade the pro@@ t@@ ag@@ on@@ ists of mis@@ gu@@ ided reforms to re@@ verse cour@@ se.
Instead, the EC@@ H@@ R@@ ’s 4@@ 7 member states – with 8@@ 00 million people – need to sh@@ oul@@ der more responsibility to make the existing system work.
La@@ un@@ ched in the after@@ mat@@ h of the Holocau@@ st, the EC@@ H@@ R has become a po@@ tent symbo@@ l of Europe’s commitment to government by law, not forc@@ e, by vin@@ dic@@ ating the rights to lif@@ e, human@@ e treat@@ ment, free ex@@ pres@@ sion, and access to a law@@ y@@ er.
For example, the Court rul@@ ed that the in@@ fam@@ ous “@@ five techni@@ ques@@ ” – an early form of “@@ enh@@ anced inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation@@ ” employ@@ ed by the British in Nor@@ thern I@@ re@@ land in the 197@@ 0’s – con@@ stit@@ uted in@@ human treat@@ ment, and condem@@ ned ra@@ cial se@@ greg@@ ation of Rom@@ a children in C@@ ze@@ ch school@@ s.
Because of their qu@@ ality, the EC@@ H@@ R@@ ’s opini@@ ons have a pro@@ found impact beyond Europe.
When Stra@@ s@@ bo@@ ur@@ g spe@@ ak@@ s, the world’s jud@@ ges and law@@ y@@ ers li@@ sten.
Even the US Su@@ pre@@ me Court c@@ ited its reason@@ ing when stri@@ king down anti-@@ hom@@ os@@ exu@@ ality laws in T@@ ex@@ as in 200@@ 3.
N@@ on@@ eth@@ eless, the EC@@ H@@ R@@ ’s future is in serious je@@ op@@ ard@@ y.
As the only im@@ par@@ tial ch@@ ec@@ k on ab@@ use of power in some countries, the Court is s@@ w@@ amp@@ ed with comp@@ la@@ in@@ ts – more than 60@@ % come from Russia, Turke@@ y, Ital@@ y, Rom@@ ani@@ a, and Ukra@@ ine.
Some argue that the answer to the flo@@ od of cases is to limit the Cour@@ t’s power@@ s.
But that approach seems un@@ wi@@ se.
British Prime Minister David Cam@@ er@@ on, for example, has told the Parli@@ ament@@ ary As@@ sem@@ bly of the Council of Europe that national decisions “@@ should be tre@@ ated with respec@@ t” – co@@ de for less judi@@ cial over@@ si@@ gh@@ t.
Similarly, other senior officials have called for new restric@@ tions on cases that the EC@@ H@@ R may hear@@ , including de@@ fer@@ ral to those national cour@@ ts which have sup@@ pos@@ edly taken full account of European human@@ -@@ rights law@@ .
In the United King@@ dom@@ , the Cour@@ t’s 2005 ruling against a bl@@ ank@@ et withdraw@@ al of vo@@ ting rights for prison@@ ers, on the ground@@ s that di@@ sen@@ fran@@ ch@@ is@@ ement can be dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ate to the off@@ ens@@ e, provo@@ ked official w@@ ra@@ th.
And, earlier this year, the Cam@@ er@@ on government was inc@@ ens@@ ed by a decision that bar@@ red the de@@ port@@ ation of an Islamic pre@@ ach@@ er to Jord@@ an on terrorism char@@ ges, because his tri@@ al there might be tain@@ ted by evidence ob@@ tain@@ ed under tor@@ tu@@ re.
Even under new rul@@ es, such cases might still come before the Cour@@ t, because they raise fundamental questions that require interpre@@ tation of the European Con@@ ven@@ tion.
Indeed, there is no evidence that proposed Con@@ vention am@@ end@@ ments aimed at limit@@ ing the cour@@ t’s authority would reduce its cas@@ el@@ o@@ ad.
But they sen@@ d a dangerous message that some governments should be ex@@ emp@@ t from standards that app@@ ly to everyone el@@ se.
R@@ educ@@ ing the f@@ low of comp@@ la@@ in@@ ts depend@@ s, above all, on governments doing more to ent@@ ren@@ ch the rule of law at home – even if they must be push@@ ed and sh@@ am@@ ed into it.
Au@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ ative and bin@@ ding Court jud@@ g@@ ments, many of which require governments to compens@@ ate victim@@ s, are among the most effective tool@@ s for construc@@ tive pressure – and may well provide better value in promoting the rule of law than the millions of euro@@ s invest@@ ed annu@@ ally in techni@@ cal assistance and tra@@ ining in the er@@ ring states.
In addi@@ tion, legisl@@ ative reforms en@@ ac@@ ted in 2010 must be given time and resources to work.
All agree that the EC@@ H@@ R is making progress in reducing the back@@ lo@@ g of p@@ ending app@@ lic@@ ations.
More can be don@@ e.
The Court can increase the number of “@@ p@@ il@@ ot jud@@ g@@ ment@@ s” concern@@ ing system@@ ic har@@ m, pres@@ cri@@ be more specific measures of re@@ d@@ res@@ s, and sti@@ ffen monetary a@@ wards where repe@@ ated viol@@ ations reflect persi@@ st@@ ent failure to he@@ ed pri@@ or jud@@ g@@ ments.
The Commit@@ tee of Minist@@ ers, which over@@ se@@ es implement@@ ation, should issue public sanctions where appropri@@ ate.
And states must take more seri@@ ously their oblig@@ ations to re@@ m@@ ed@@ y viol@@ ations before cases reach Stra@@ s@@ bo@@ ur@@ g.
To be sure, no cour@@ t ge@@ ts every decision righ@@ t, or p@@ leas@@ es all parti@@ es.
But even democratic governments sometimes make big mistak@@ es.
Some political leaders seem too pre@@ occup@@ ied with their own dis@@ agreements with individual decisions to see the larger interest in preser@@ ving a European institu@@ tion that comm@@ ands widespread ad@@ mi@@ ra@@ tion.
The next two months will be t@@ ell@@ ing.
The U@@ K@@ , which currently hol@@ ds the ro@@ t@@ ating Council of Europe Cha@@ ir@@ , has announced that it will seek adop@@ tion by April of a ministeri@@ al decl@@ ar@@ ation on Court reform@@ .
Th@@ ough a dra@@ ft is now cir@@ cul@@ ating in national capit@@ als, the role of ci@@ vil@@ -@@ society groups remains un@@ cle@@ ar.
It is crucial that those who have the greatest st@@ ake in the EC@@ H@@ R – Europe’s people – particip@@ ate mean@@ ing@@ fully in these discus@@ sions.
In a time of financial constra@@ in@@ t, the Cour@@ t’s jud@@ ges issue more than 1@@ ,000 rul@@ ings annu@@ ally, many of great import@@ ance, for less than the cost of the EU’s public@@ ations budge@@ t.
A hal@@ f-@@ century after its bir@@ th, the EC@@ H@@ R provides an inv@@ al@@ u@@ able public go@@ od, not just for Europe@@ ans, but for all people concerned with human rights any@@ wher@@ e.
In the coming week@@ s, Europe’s governments will be measu@@ red by their commitment to the preser@@ v@@ ation of this vital global resour@@ ce.
If the late great Argent@@ ine econom@@ ist Rau@@ l Pre@@ b@@ isch were ali@@ ve today, he no doubt would won@@ der whether the world had turned up@@ side dow@@ n.
His hu@@ gely influ@@ ential “@@ depen@@ den@@ cy@@ ” theory argued that if poor countries reli@@ ed too much on commodi@@ ty export@@ s, they would never achieve the industrial dep@@ th needed to su@@ sta@@ in rapid growth.
Instead, they would become mi@@ red in a cy@@ cle of decl@@ ining global commodi@@ ty prices and ever@@ -@@ d@@ win@@ d@@ ling income shar@@ es.
Pre@@ bi@@ sch@@ ’s prefer@@ red policy respon@@ se, protection@@ ism, pro@@ ved disa@@ stro@@ us for the many Latin American and African countries that he@@ e@@ ded him@@ .
But the fact is that for many years, Pre@@ b@@ isch seemed to have made the right call on long-term commodi@@ ty price tren@@ ds.
R@@ el@@ ent@@ less effici@@ ency gains in agri@@ culture and resour@@ ce ex@@ trac@@ tion push@@ ed down prices for commodi@@ ties, especially during the 198@@ 0’s and 199@@ 0’s.
With few excep@@ tions, countries that focused on commodi@@ ty exports per@@ form@@ ed dis@@ m@@ ally, whereas many resourc@@ e-@@ poor Asian countries rac@@ ed ahe@@ ad.
Today, however, with Asi@@ a’s gi@@ ant@@ s, India and China, jo@@ ining the global economy, prices for o@@ il, g@@ ol@@ d, whe@@ at, and virtually every other commodi@@ ty are explo@@ d@@ ing.
While there will always be cy@@ cl@@ es – oil prices, for example, will probably fall before they start rising again – the long-@@ run tren@@ d for many commodi@@ ties will clearly remain up@@ ward for some time to come.
What many trade negoti@@ ators and other policymakers do not seem to have recognized ye@@ t, though Pre@@ b@@ isch would have re@@ alized it inst@@ antly, is that this dramatic turn of events car@@ ries huge implic@@ ations for the global balance of power.
Indeed, perhaps no other asp@@ ect of economic globalization will pose greater challenges to world leaders over the coming decades.
The questions are man@@ y.
Ar@@ e today’s rich countries prepared for an era of co-@@ depen@@ den@@ cy, in which they are just as des@@ per@@ ate for commodi@@ ties as developing countries are for industrial impor@@ ts and technolog@@ y?
Ar@@ e they prepared for the inevit@@ able f@@ low of power and influence to commodi@@ ty produc@@ ers as they become much weal@@ th@@ ier@@ ?
How will the world’s two super@@ power@@ s, China and the United States, come to terms with the fact that important commodi@@ t@@ y-@@ expor@@ ting regions from Africa to the Middle East to Central Asia are lit@@ tered with ill@@ -@@ form@@ ed nation stat@@ es?
Some self-@@ ano@@ in@@ ted se@@ ers por@@ tra@@ y the problem as being one of fin@@ ite natural resourc@@ es, with the world running out of critical commodi@@ ties at an al@@ arm@@ ing rat@@ e.
N@@ ow@@ ad@@ ay@@ s, there are many ad@@ her@@ ents of the “@@ H@@ ub@@ ber@@ t’s pe@@ ak@@ ” theory of oil produc@@ tion, which hol@@ ds that we have reached the u@@ pp@@ er limits of output capac@@ ity, the well@@ s are running dr@@ y, and it is all down@@ h@@ ill from her@@ e.
However, as leading oil histori@@ an D@@ an Y@@ erg@@ in points out, pro@@ ph@@ ets of do@@ om have declared that the world is running out of oil at least four times al@@ read@@ y.
E@@ ach time, radical impro@@ vem@@ ents in technology made the threat ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ate.
In the late 18@@ 00@@ ’@@ s, oil ex@@ trac@@ tion involved dre@@ d@@ ging with a mu@@ le.
Today, no one thin@@ ks anything of dri@@ ll@@ ing 3@@ ,000 me@@ ters ben@@ e@@ ath the oc@@ e@@ an flo@@ or.
There have been similar impro@@ vem@@ ents across the bo@@ ard in met@@ als min@@ ing and agri@@ cultu@@ re.
No@@ , the world is not about to run out of commodi@@ ties.
Instead, what is happ@@ ening is that the integration of 2.@@ 5 billion people (@@ China and India al@@ on@@ e) into the global economy is produc@@ ing a demand shift that is likely to put far more up@@ ward pressure on commodi@@ ty prices than any technology gains are likely to off@@ s@@ et.
So, for at least the next 50 to 7@@ 5 years, and perhaps until hum@@ ans start min@@ ing on Mar@@ s some@@ time in the coming cent@@ uri@@ es, prices for many natural resources are he@@ aded up@@ .
Will the re@@ balanc@@ ing of global economic power that results from this destabili@@ ze world politic@@ s?
World War I@@ , of course, was partly set off by Germany’s concern that the other col@@ oni@@ al powers had lock@@ ed up too large a share of world oil and commodi@@ ty supp@@ li@@ es.
Similarly, in World War II@@ , Japan fear@@ ed for the stability of its foreign supp@@ lies of oil and other natural resourc@@ es.
Will similar ten@@ sions ar@@ ise between resourc@@ e-@@ challeng@@ ed China (@@ where even water scar@@ city is a problem@@ ) and the West@@ ?
For@@ tun@@ ately, this does not seem likely for the mom@@ ent, especially given the Chinese leader@@ ship@@ ’s so@@ ber and pragmati@@ c approach to its resour@@ ce problems.
The Chinese are looking to regions like Africa, hop@@ ing to find stable trading partn@@ ers.
They do not share the political ev@@ ange@@ li@@ sm of the Americ@@ ans, who don’t just want to trade with commodi@@ ty expor@@ ters, but to conver@@ t them as well.
Th@@ en there are those American leaders who still spe@@ ak of making the US self-@@ sufficient in energy supp@@ li@@ es.
But this is basi@@ cally a j@@ ok@@ e: self-@@ in@@ dul@@ g@@ ent, ma@@ y@@ be, but self-@@ suffici@@ ent, ne@@ ver@@ .
Mu@@ ch of the Arab world understand@@ ably views the inv@@ asion of Iraq as the cor@@ ner@@ st@@ one of the real US strategy for sec@@ uring stable energy supp@@ li@@ es.
If they are righ@@ t, one can only hope that America has a plan B.
Meanwhile, commodi@@ ty prices will continue to ris@@ e, with oil expor@@ ters now con@@ stit@@ ut@@ ing the largest contribut@@ ors to America’s g@@ ap@@ ing trade defic@@ it.
Ma@@ y@@ be the real US strategy is to try to ow@@ e the commodi@@ t@@ y-@@ expor@@ ting countries so much money that they will feel dependent on making America happ@@ y@@ !
That is one t@@ wi@@ st that Pre@@ b@@ isch would never have anti@@ cip@@ ated.
For@@ ty years ago, Char@@ les de G@@ aul@@ le said "@@ N@@ on@@ " to Britain@@ 's requ@@ est to join the European Commun@@ ity.
By Jun@@ e 9, British Chanc@@ ell@@ or of the Ex@@ ch@@ equ@@ er G@@ ord@@ on B@@ rown will offer his own "@@ No@@ " to Europe.
But Britain@@ 's decision whether to join the single European curren@@ cy, the Euro@@ , was taken long ago, and it was always going to be some ver@@ sion of "@@ No@@ ."
When France first inv@@ ited Britain to join the inf@@ ant European enterpri@@ se, a decade before General de G@@ aul@@ le bar@@ red the do@@ or, the super@@ ci@@ li@@ ous mand@@ ar@@ ins in Britain@@ 's Treasury ensu@@ red that Britain would in@@ dig@@ n@@ antly re@@ ject the off@@ er.
Treasury bureauc@@ rats have remained predict@@ ably anti-@@ European ever sin@@ ce.
Like the cour@@ ti@@ ers who sur@@ ro@@ unded L@@ ou@@ is X@@ V@@ II@@ I@@ , they have for@@ go@@ tten nothing and learned no@@ th@@ ing.
The only question now in doubt is whether B@@ row@@ n@@ 's ver@@ dic@@ t on the Euro will be "@@ Not quite y@@ et@@ ," "@@ Not before the next elec@@ tion@@ ," or just pla@@ in "@@ No@@ ."
It is a decision being taken virtually in@@ depend@@ ently of Prime Minister Tony Bla@@ ir@@ , and even against his wi@@ sh@@ es.
Blair believ@@ es that Britain ought to join the Euro@@ , because he wants Britain to be, as he put@@ s it, "@@ at the heart of Europe@@ "@@ .
Most com@@ ment@@ ators ten@@ ded to assu@@ me that, if th@@ at@@ 's what Tony Blair w@@ ant@@ s, then so@@ on@@ er or later that is what will happ@@ en, bec@@ aus@@ e, after all, he is the Prime Minist@@ er.
The f@@ law in this reason@@ ing is that Blair sur@@ ren@@ der@@ ed control of the single currency decision to the Treasury early in his first ter@@ m, and he has never had the c@@ oura@@ ge or political streng@@ th to take it back@@ .
It is sometimes said that Tony Blair is in@@ stinc@@ tively European (@@ though that is said less often since the Iraq war@@ ).
But when he came to power, in 199@@ 7, he was not able or willing to face down Britain@@ 's traditional anti-@@ Europe@@ an@@ ism@@ ; in particul@@ ar, he was not prepared to com@@ mit his government to event@@ ual Euro member@@ ship.
Bla@@ ir@@ 's solution to his Euro di@@ lemm@@ a was to pre@@ tend that adop@@ ting the Euro was not a major political deci@@ sion, but a techni@@ cal ques@@ tion, to be decided on "@@ pu@@ rel@@ y@@ " economic ground@@ s.
So, in Oc@@ tober 199@@ 7, G@@ ord@@ on B@@ rown announced that he had de@@ vis@@ ed five tests to see whether Britain and the Euro were su@@ ited to each other.
In due course, the Treasury would reach a jud@@ g@@ ment that would be techni@@ cally exper@@ t, economic@@ ally im@@ parti@@ al, and politically neut@@ ral@@ .
If Tony Blair ever believed any of this, he was a fo@@ ol@@ .
B@@ rown claim@@ ed that his five tests would produce answer@@ s that were pla@@ in and un@@ am@@ big@@ u@@ ous.
Yet, because they were all questions about the futu@@ re, they would inevit@@ ably be based entirely on specul@@ ation.
Wh@@ ere G@@ ord@@ on B@@ rown himself really stands on the issue is un@@ cle@@ ar, because he is a deeply secre@@ tive man@@ .
Many believe that his primary concern in the Euro debate is over how it affec@@ ts his power vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ v@@ is Bla@@ ir@@ .
In any ev@@ ent, once the decision of principle had been sub@@ ordin@@ ated to ost@@ ensi@@ bly techni@@ cal economic test@@ s, it was un@@ avo@@ id@@ able that Treasury mand@@ ar@@ in@@ s, who are institution@@ ally op@@ posed to European integra@@ tion, would conduc@@ t them.
So the ver@@ dic@@ t was always going to be "@@ No@@ ," which is why the only freedom of movement for Blair and B@@ rown was going to be "@@ Not y@@ et@@ ."
Of course, there is not and cannot be an over@@ power@@ ing economic case for jo@@ ining the Euro@@ , at any time.
I@@ mag@@ ine that the British government deci@@ des one day to go for Euro member@@ ship, and to put the issue to the test of a refer@@ end@@ um.
At the mom@@ ent, the elector@@ ate is hosti@@ le to Euro membership by a large margin@@ ; if the government is to persu@@ ade the voters to change their min@@ ds on pu@@ rely economic ground@@ s, it must dep@@ lo@@ y a powerful cas@@ e.
V@@ o@@ ters will not be im@@ pressed by the Treas@@ ur@@ y's m@@ um@@ bo@@ -@@ j@@ um@@ bo@@ ; they will need stron@@ g, simple argum@@ ents that Britain will be better off by jo@@ in@@ ing.
If the British economy and the Euro@@ -@@ zone economy are both doing well@@ , the economic case for British membership is ob@@ viously weak@@ .
The same is true if the British economy and the Euro@@ -@@ zone economy are both doing b@@ ad@@ ly.
If the British economy is doing well and the Euro@@ -@@ zone economy is doing b@@ ad@@ ly, there is no economic case what@@ so@@ ever for British member@@ ship.
That is the current situ@@ ation.
The only scenari@@ o in which there could be a stron@@ g, pu@@ rely economic case for Euro membership is one in which the Euro@@ -@@ zone is doing very well@@ , the British economy is doing very b@@ ad@@ ly, and membership looks like the best way to deli@@ ver long-term recover@@ y.
But if the British economy were doing very b@@ ad@@ ly, the other member states might s@@ nu@@ b Britain@@ .
Ob@@ vi@@ ously, "@@ doing well@@ " and "@@ doing b@@ ad@@ ly@@ " are cl@@ ums@@ y no@@ tions@@ ; but we are tal@@ king about a refer@@ end@@ um, not about higher ma@@ themati@@ c@@ s.
A refer@@ endum on jo@@ ining the Euro probably cannot be won unless a British government is willing to say three th@@ ing@@ s: fir@@ st, that it favor@@ s closer EU political integra@@ tion@@ ; sec@@ ond, that the single currency is but one ex@@ pression of that integra@@ tion, and thir@@ d, that it is committed to Euro member@@ ship.
C@@ uri@@ ously, many voters who op@@ pose Euro membership non@@ eth@@ eless believe that it will happ@@ en.
No doubt they would pre@@ fer the government to tel@@ l them the truth fir@@ st.
M@@ OS@@ CO@@ W – Germany’s ex@@ -@@ Chanc@@ ell@@ or Ger@@ hard Sch@@ ro@@ e@@ der is a le@@ gend in Russia.
He ser@@ ves Gaz@@ pro@@ m@@ ’s interests for a meas@@ ly cou@@ ple of million euro@@ s a year, si@@ ts in at s@@ es@@ sions of the Russian Ac@@ adem@@ y of S@@ ci@@ enc@@ es, and w@@ rit@@ es book@@ s about his staun@@ ch friend@@ ship with “@@ Gen@@ os@@ se W@@ ladi@@ mir@@ ,” wh@@ o, in the no@@ t-@@ so-@@ dist@@ ant past@@ , ear@@ ned himself the well-@@ deser@@ ved ni@@ ck@@ name of “@@ St@@ asi@@ ” among business cir@@ cl@@ es in gang@@ ster@@ -@@ ri@@ d@@ den S@@ t.

But it is not immedi@@ ately obvious whether it is Sch@@ ro@@ e@@ der li@@ ck@@ ing Putin’s boo@@ ts nowad@@ a@@ ys or vice ver@@ sa@@ .
The two of them are buil@@ d@@ ing, or trying to buil@@ d, the Nor@@ d Stre@@ am gas pi@@ pel@@ ine, an excep@@ tion@@ ally cost@@ ly project that sati@@ s@@ fi@@ es tw@@ in strategic objec@@ tiv@@ es.
Demon@@ st@@ rati@@ vely hosti@@ le to the interests of both Bel@@ ar@@ us and Ukra@@ ine, the pi@@ pel@@ ine is inten@@ ded to ensure that these countries are under Russia’s energy th@@ um@@ b@@ , reg@@ ardless of who is in power in M@@ ins@@ k and K@@ iev@@ .
As a b@@ on@@ us, the pi@@ pel@@ ine will also consolid@@ ate the Russian econom@@ y’s status as an app@@ en@@ da@@ ge of Germany’s – its supp@@ lier of natural resourc@@ es.
C@@ er@@ tain of Sch@@ ro@@ eder@@ ’s pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ ors as German chan@@ c@@ ell@@ or sought to at@@ tain the same objec@@ tive by rather different mean@@ s.
The Krem@@ lin@@ ’s achiev@@ ements in sec@@ uring the help of Americans willing to offer their influence are equally im@@ pres@@ si@@ ve.
Indeed, the Obama administ@@ ration@@ ’s Russia policy is being n@@ ur@@ tured with ad@@ vice from people who have no official position in the administration but close business ties to Russia and the Krem@@ lin@@ : H@@ en@@ ry K@@ is@@ sing@@ er, J@@ am@@ es A@@ . B@@ ak@@ er, Th@@ om@@ as Gra@@ ham@@ , and Di@@ mit@@ ri Sim@@ es.
The first two are major ge@@ o-@@ politici@@ ans@@ ; Gra@@ ha@@ m and Sim@@ es are respec@@ ted as out@@ standing Russia speci@@ ali@@ st@@ s.
They wri@@ te key repor@@ ts for the administ@@ ration, and sh@@ ut@@ t@@ le between Mosco@@ w and Washingt@@ on, coordin@@ ating the par@@ am@@ e@@ ters of the Obama administ@@ ration@@ ’s effort to “@@ res@@ et@@ ” the bilateral relation@@ ship.
Like Sch@@ ro@@ e@@ der, all these people are not economic@@ ally di@@ sin@@ ter@@ es@@ ted.
B@@ ak@@ er is a con@@ sul@@ t@@ ant for the two companies at the comm@@ anding hei@@ gh@@ ts of the Russian economy, Gaz@@ pro@@ m and R@@ os@@ ne@@ ft.
The K@@ is@@ sing@@ er As@@ soci@@ ates lob@@ b@@ ying group@@ , whose Russian sec@@ tion is he@@ aded by Gra@@ ham@@ , fe@@ eds in to the K@@ is@@ sing@@ er-@@ Pri@@ mak@@ o@@ v working group@@ , a qu@@ asi@@ -@@ priv@@ ate-@@ sector effor@@ t, bl@@ essed by Put@@ in, to deep@@ en ties between Russia and the United Stat@@ es.
It is highly in@@ struc@@ tive to re@@ ad the re@@ commen@@ d@@ ations of these people and group@@ s, as they un@@ ob@@ tru@@ si@@ vely ren@@ der the objec@@ tives of their Kremlin cli@@ ents into a langu@@ age famili@@ ar to American leader@@ s.
Gra@@ ham@@ ’s latest contribu@@ tion, “@@ Res@@ urg@@ ent Russia and US P@@ ur@@ pos@@ es@@ ,” is most reve@@ aling in this respec@@ t.
The auth@@ or fin@@ ds the government of a “@@ Russia getting up off its k@@ ne@@ es” to consi@@ st of progres@@ sive moderni@@ z@@ ers fully aw@@ are of the challenges facing their country as it attemp@@ ts to “@@ return to the great powers cl@@ ub@@ .”
“@@ In order to become a genu@@ in@@ ely developed and modern countr@@ y@@ ,” Gra@@ ha@@ m continu@@ es, “@@ in the coming decade Russia will need to invest at least one trillion dollars in moderni@@ zing its infrastructu@@ re.
America and the West in general have a vital interest in se@@ eing the moderni@@ zation of Russia succe@@ ed.
The li@@ on@@ 's share of the technologi@@ es, know@@ -@@ ho@@ w@@ , and a substantial propor@@ tion of the invest@@ ment, needs to come from Europe and the USA@@ .”
In addi@@ tion to the technology and invest@@ ments, Gra@@ ha@@ m qui@@ et@@ ly s@@ li@@ ps in a foreign policy sug@@ ges@@ tion for the Obama administration that is s@@ ure to p@@ le@@ ase the Krem@@ lin@@ : “@@ Fin@@ lan@@ di@@ z@@ ing@@ ” Ukra@@ ine.
Un@@ less that sort of appe@@ as@@ ement is pursu@@ ed, he warn@@ s, Russia will continue to op@@ pose the US “@@ wher@@ ever and wh@@ en@@ ever it can@@ .” According to Gra@@ ham@@ , “@@ At the extre@@ me, a weak Russia, with its vast resources and spar@@ se population e@@ ast of the U@@ ral@@ s, could become the ob@@ ject of competition among the great power@@ s, not@@ ably China and the United Stat@@ es@@ .”
That uns@@ po@@ ken help@@ -@@ us@@ -@@ develop@@ -@@ or@@ -@@ we@@ ’@@ ll@@ -@@ le@@ t-@@ th@@ e-@@ Chin@@ es@@ e-@@ do@@ -@@ it threat is a logi@@ cal development of Prime Minister Putin’s hom@@ ily at this year@@ ’s World Economic For@@ um in Da@@ vo@@ s, where he advoc@@ ated deci@@ sive action to end the world economic crisis.
His re@@ ci@@ pe@@ ?
Western countries should wri@@ te off half a trillion dollar@@ s’ worth of debt ow@@ ed to them by the Russian state corpor@@ ations run by his p@@ als from the D@@ res@@ den K@@ G@@ B and the O@@ zer@@ o dach@@ a cooper@@ ativ@@ e.
But no amount of money will succe@@ ed in moderni@@ zing Putin@@ 's kle@@ p@@ to@@ c@@ ratic regi@@ me, which has already squ@@ ander@@ ed trilli@@ ons in oil weal@@ th.
S@@ imp@@ ly pu@@ t, the Putin system is politi@@ call@@ y, institution@@ ally, and intellec@@ tually anti@@ the@@ tical to the task of moderni@@ z@@ ation.
Gra@@ ham@@ ’s only er@@ ror in his pres@@ ent@@ ation is his attempt to fri@@ gh@@ ten the administration with a hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical confron@@ tation between the US and China over Russian resourc@@ es.
This is not his area of speci@@ aliz@@ ation.
K@@ is@@ sing@@ er works person@@ ally with the Chinese accoun@@ t, jo@@ in@@ tly pro@@ po@@ und@@ ing with his long-@@ time ri@@ val Z@@ big@@ ni@@ e@@ w Br@@ ze@@ z@@ ins@@ k@@ i the no@@ tion, so s@@ educ@@ tive for an America growing we@@ ary of its imperi@@ al bur@@ den, of a global B@@ ig T@@ wo@@ .
H@@ ere is a recent s@@ amp@@ le of K@@ is@@ sing@@ er@@ ’s geo@@ political ar@@ ts@@ : “@@ The role of China in a new world order is cru@@ ci@@ al.
A relationship that started on both sides as essen@@ tially a strategic desig@@ n to constra@@ in a common ad@@ vers@@ ary has evol@@ ved over the decades into a p@@ ill@@ ar of the international system@@ ..@@ . The Sin@@ o-@@ American relationship needs to be taken to a new level@@ .
This generation of leaders has the opportunity to shap@@ e relations into a desig@@ n for a common dest@@ in@@ y, much as was done with trans@@ -@@ Atlan@@ tic relations in the post-@@ war peri@@ od@@ .”
No doubt K@@ is@@ sing@@ er believ@@ es every wor@@ d he w@@ ro@@ te, but his ideas also hon@@ est@@ ly ar@@ ticul@@ ate the as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions of his custom@@ ers.
It@@ ’s just that not all custom@@ ers have the same mo@@ tiv@@ es.
One wants to get his ho@@ ok@@ s into a further trillion dollars that it can p@@ ick away at, while the other wants to become “@@ a central construc@@ t of the system of international rel@@ ations@@ .”
But, in both cas@@ es, the custom@@ ers are getting the influence for which they are pay@@ ing.
The list of urg@@ ent challenges facing human@@ ity is de@@ press@@ ingly lon@@ g.
AIDS@@ , hung@@ er, armed conflic@@ t, and global warming compe@@ te for attention al@@ ong@@ side government fail@@ u@@ re, mal@@ ari@@ a, and the latest natural disa@@ st@@ er.
While our comp@@ as@@ sion is gre@@ at, our resources are limit@@ ed.
So who should be helped fir@@ st@@ ? 
To som@@ e, making such priori@@ ties seems ob@@ sc@@ en@@ e.
But the United Nations and national governments spend billi@@ ons of dollars each year trying to help those in need without exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly consider@@ ing whether they are achiev@@ ing the most that they can@@ .
The wes@@ tern media foc@@ uses on a ts@@ un@@ am@@ i in Asi@@ a@@ ; don@@ ations f@@ low fre@@ el@@ y.
An ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake that dev@@ a@@ states Pakistan gar@@ ners fe@@ wer head@@ lin@@ es, so the developed world gi@@ ves a lot l@@ ess.
There is a better way.
We could priori@@ ti@@ ze our spending to achieve the greatest benefit for our mone@@ y. 
This mon@@ th, I will ask UN am@@ b@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors how they would spend $@@ 50 billion to reduce suff@@ er@@ ing.
They will repe@@ at the same exerc@@ ise that some of the world’s best economists tac@@ kl@@ ed in a 2004 project called the “@@ Copen@@ hagen Con@@ sen@@ sus@@ ”@@ : wei@@ gh@@ ing up solu@@ tions to the great challenges facing the world, and deci@@ ding what should be done fir@@ st. 
But the question sh@@ oul@@ d@@ n’t be left to politicians or Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates al@@ one.
We must all eng@@ age in the deb@@ ate.
One hop@@ es that this task has been made s@@ ligh@@ tly si@@ m@@ pl@@ er by the public@@ ation of a book in which the Copen@@ hagen Con@@ sen@@ sus economists bo@@ il down their insi@@ gh@@ ts.
Her@@ e’s one fact to consider@@ : the entire death t@@ ol@@ l from the Sou@@ the@@ ast Asian ts@@ un@@ am@@ i is mat@@ ched each month by the number of worldwide cas@@ u@@ al@@ ties of HIV@@ /@@ AIDS@@ .
A comprehensive pre@@ vention program providing free or che@@ ap con@@ dom@@ s and information about safe se@@ x to the regions worst affec@@ ted by HIV@@ /@@ AIDS would cost $@@ 2@@ 7 billion and save more than 2@@ 8 million li@@ ves.
Th@@ is, say the economists who took part in the Copen@@ hagen Con@@ sen@@ s@@ us, makes it the single best investment that the world could possibly mak@@ e.
The social benefits would out@@ wei@@ gh the costs by 40 to one. 
Other op@@ tions that the economists favor@@ ed spending some of their $@@ 50 billion include providing m@@ icro@@ -@@ n@@ ut@@ ri@@ ents to the world’s hung@@ ry, establish@@ ing free tra@@ de, and batt@@ ling mal@@ aria with mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to n@@ ets and medic@@ ation.
At the other end of the sc@@ al@@ e, respon@@ ses to climate change like the Kyoto Proto@@ co@@ l would cost more than they would achiev@@ e, so the economists cros@@ sed them off the list of things to do right now.
Re@@ g@@ ardless of whether we agree with the econom@@ ist@@ s, every@@ body must ad@@ mit that we cannot do everything at on@@ ce.
Dis@@ c@@ uss@@ ing our priori@@ ties is cru@@ ci@@ al.
O@@ f@@ ten, politicians avoid priori@@ tiz@@ ation.
Wh@@ y?
The g@@ li@@ b answer is because it is har@@ d.
There are many interest@@ ed parti@@ es.
No group wants their solution to come la@@ st, and no government wants its country’s national challenges to be over@@ look@@ ed. 
The UN con@@ ference won@@ ’t be eas@@ y.
But it shows that there is a will to put priori@@ tiz@@ ation s@@ quar@@ ely at the center of atten@@ tion.
It will produce a “@@ to do@@ ” list that will demon@@ st@@ rate how to achieve the most that we can for human@@ ity, which could lead@@ , in tur@@ n, to more transpar@@ ent decision@@ -@@ mak@@ ing.
The principles of economics provide a sound basis on which to make rational choic@@ es.
N@@ ow, the discus@@ sion needs to shift from the academ@@ ic sph@@ ere to political life.
It@@ ’s time for all of us to consider and comp@@ are our own pri@@ ority li@@ st@@ s. 
We must en@@ de@@ a@@ vor to shor@@ ten the list of challenges facing human@@ ity.
But that requires all of us to eng@@ age in a debate about what we need to do fir@@ st.
W@@ AS@@ HI@@ NG@@ T@@ ON@@ , D@@ C – Robert Z@@ o@@ el@@ li@@ ck will de@@ part in Jun@@ e as President of the World Bank, once again raising the th@@ or@@ n@@ y issue of leadership of the Bre@@ tt@@ on Wo@@ ods tw@@ ins (the Bank and the International Monetary Fund@@ ).
At their bir@@ th, John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Keynes mem@@ or@@ ably war@@ ned that if these institutions did not get good leaders they would “@@ fall into an e@@ ternal s@@ l@@ um@@ ber, never to w@@ ak@@ en or be hear@@ d of again in the cour@@ ts and markets of M@@ ank@@ in@@ d@@ .”
G@@ et@@ ting a good lea@@ der, of course, requires a car@@ eful sel@@ ec@@ tion process.
Today, however, the world is stu@@ ck with just the opposi@@ te: a d@@ read@@ fully anti@@ qu@@ ated process wher@@ e@@ by the United States and Europe, despite their economic tra@@ v@@ ail@@ s, re@@ tain a mon@@ opol@@ y on the leadership of the Bank and the IMF@@ , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y.
There is g@@ ru@@ d@@ ging agreement that this system should change. But the forces per@@ pet@@ u@@ ating the status qu@@ o – European and American resist@@ ance to change and emerg@@ ing-@@ market countries’ passi@@ v@@ ity – remain power@@ ful@@ , as the choice last year of Chri@@ st@@ ine L@@ ag@@ ar@@ de to lead the IMF illu@@ strat@@ ed.
E@@ lec@@ tion@@ -@@ year politics in the US will strengthen these forces fur@@ ther, with President Barack Obama’s administration unlikely to rel@@ in@@ qu@@ ish a symbo@@ l of global power, which would inv@@ ite oppon@@ ent@@ s’ charg@@ es of weak leader@@ ship.
But, in some way@@ s, the easy part is to state the case for the ob@@ vi@@ ous@@ : the Bank requires a new sel@@ ec@@ tion process that will enable it to choose the most quali@@ fied person@@ , reg@@ ardless of nation@@ ality.
The more difficult part is to identi@@ fy the quali@@ fic@@ ations needed to run the Bank at a time when its role must be adap@@ ted to f@@ ar-@@ reach@@ ing global chan@@ ges.
For the first time in a long time, a significant number of poor countries are cat@@ ching up to the advanced economies, and the list of development success@@ es is l@@ eng@@ th@@ en@@ ing.
That means that more of the poorest countries will therefore gradu@@ ate out of the need for conc@@ ession@@ al lending from the Bank@@ .
The Bank@@ ’s non-@@ conc@@ ession@@ al lending agen@@ cy, the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struc@@ tion and Develop@@ ment, may well re@@ tain its ration@@ al@@ e, especially because thre@@ e-@@ fo@@ ur@@ th@@ s of the world’s poor now res@@ ide in m@@ idd@@ le-@@ income countries.
But easier access to private finance will force a re-@@ ev@@ al@@ u@@ ation of the I@@ BR@@ D@@ ’s metho@@ ds and the mag@@ nit@@ u@@ de of its l@@ end@@ ing.
For example, countries may want the Bank to continue to provide neut@@ ral ad@@ vice and set standards on proc@@ u@@ re@@ ment and qu@@ ality, but without the high trans@@ actions costs that have become the h@@ all@@ mark of Bank finan@@ ce.
At the same time, many of the development challenges in the for@@ es@@ ee@@ able future – climate change, low agricultural produc@@ tiv@@ ity, growing water scar@@ city –@@ &nbsp;@@ are increasingly global in natu@@ re.
Lo@@ ok@@ ing ahe@@ ad, the Bank will have to shift from lending to governments towards financing the provi@@ sion of global public good@@ s.
A more successful developing world also poses an intellectual challenge to the Bank as a cu@@ sto@@ di@@ an of research and policy thinking in the fiel@@ d of development economic@@ s.
The Bank, which has draw@@ n pre@@ domin@@ antly upon US-@@ based cent@@ ers of lear@@ n@@ ing, can no longer p@@ ly a single model or dict@@ ate from a universal tem@@ pl@@ ate.
To be fair@@ , the Bank has emb@@ rac@@ ed the message of ec@@ lec@@ tic@@ ism, but a new leader will have to go fur@@ ther, pa@@ ying greater attention to the specific con@@ tex@@ ts and demands of individual bor@@ ro@@ wer@@ s and lear@@ ning from a wider set of successful development experienc@@ es.
The Bank@@ ’s major sharehol@@ ders also face a stark choic@@ e.
If they believe that the Bank has a mean@@ ing@@ ful future worth sup@@ port@@ ing, it is the rapidly growing emerg@@ ing-@@ market countries, not the in@@ deb@@ ted Wes@@ t, that can provide the resources (@@ this means China, of course, but even Brazi@@ l and India have growing aid program@@ s@@ ).
In retur@@ n, they will righ@@ tly demand a greater vo@@ ice in running the Bank, especially if the Bank@@ ’s focus shif@@ ts towards global public good@@ s.
But if the status qu@@ o powers are un@@ willing to c@@ e@@ de contro@@ l, the system of official international financing established by Bre@@ tt@@ on Wo@@ ods will become increasingly frag@@ ment@@ ed.
Coun@@ tries like China will be rein@@ forced in their belief that going it alone is the best op@@ tion, with ad@@ verse consequences for multilater@@ alism.
These dramatic shif@@ ts and da@@ un@@ ting challenges mean that the World Bank@@ ’s next president will have to be some@@ one whose primary task is to initi@@ ate and su@@ sta@@ in change while comm@@ anding support and legitimacy across the Bank@@ ’s member@@ ship.
He or she will also require a demonstrat@@ ed capacity for political leadership and a core con@@ vic@@ tion that the Bank needs a new vision and path for@@ war@@ d.
It is im@@ per@@ ative that the sel@@ ec@@ tion process be al@@ tered to bro@@ aden the se@@ ar@@ ch for candidates who are sensi@@ tive to changing re@@ ali@@ ties and pos@@ s@@ ess key quali@@ fic@@ ations.
This would not mean ruling out a deser@@ ving American candidate such as H@@ ill@@ ary Clint@@ on, but it would also mean looking car@@ eful@@ ly at other@@ s, such as former Pres@@ id@@ ents Lu@@ i@@ z In@@ á@@ ci@@ o L@@ ula da S@@ il@@ v@@ a of Brazi@@ l and Ern@@ es@@ to Z@@ edi@@ ll@@ o of Mexico@@ ; N@@ go@@ z@@ i O@@ kon@@ jo@@ -@@ I@@ weal@@ a, the economics c@@ z@@ ar@@ in@@ a in Nigeri@@ a@@ ; M@@ o I@@ bra@@ him@@ , an ex@@ em@@ pl@@ ar of African business success@@ ; N@@ and@@ an Ni@@ le@@ kan@@ i, the Indian so@@ ft@@ w@@ are mo@@ g@@ ul@@ -@@ tur@@ n@@ ed-@@ develop@@ ment@@ -@@ offici@@ al@@ ; and An@@ dre@@ w Sh@@ en@@ g of Malaysi@@ a, a dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ished former financial regul@@ ator@@ .
The current sel@@ ec@@ tion proc@@ ed@@ ure is los@@ ing legitimacy in a changing world, and it car@@ ries greater risks of a bad out@@ com@@ e: an un@@ su@@ it@@ able candid@@ ate.
The consequences of re@@ tain@@ ing it might not be as dramatic as Keyn@@ es’ pro@@ ph@@ esi@@ ed, but there is a real possibility that the Bank will os@@ si@@ fy into an institu@@ tion whose increasingly im@@ pover@@ ished G-@@ 7 don@@ ors disp@@ ense progres@@ si@@ vely smaller su@@ ms of money in the same ques@@ tion@@ able ways to a shr@@ in@@ king number of supp@@ lic@@ ant@@ s.
NEW HA@@ V@@ E@@ N – Central bank@@ ers around the world failed to see the current financial crisis coming before its beginn@@ ings in 200@@ 7.
Mar@@ ti@@ n Č@@ ih@@ á@@ k of the International Monetary Fund repor@@ ted in Ju@@ ly 2007 that, of 4@@ 7 central banks found to publi@@ sh financial stability repor@@ ts (@@ FS@@ R@@ s@@ ), “@@ virtually all@@ ” gave a “@@ positive overall ass@@ ess@@ ment of their domestic financial system@@ ” in their most recent re@@ port@@ s.
And ye@@ t, although these central banks failed us before the crisis, they should still play the lead role in prev@@ enting the next crisis.
That is the conclu@@ sion, perhaps counter@@ in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive, that the S@@ qu@@ am L@@ ake G@@ rou@@ p [@@ h@@ tt@@ p@@ :@@ /@@ /@@ squ@@ am@@ l@@ ake@@ group@@ .@@ org@@ /@@ ]@@ , a think t@@ ank of 15 academ@@ ic financial economists to which I bel@@ on@@ g, reached in our recently publi@@ shed re@@ port@@ ,@@ Fi@@ x@@ ing the Financial System@@ .
M@@ ac@@ ro@@ -@@ p@@ ru@@ denti@@ al regul@@ ators (@@ government officials who focus not on the so@@ und@@ ness of individual financial institutions, but rather on the stability of the whole financial system@@ ) are sor@@ ely nee@@ ded, and central bank@@ ers are the logi@@ cal people to f@@ ill this ro@@ le.
Other regul@@ ators did no better in predic@@ ting this crisis, and are even less su@@ ited to prevent the ne@@ x@@ t.
David Cam@@ er@@ on’s new government in the United King@@ dom appar@@ ently came to the same conclu@@ sion when it announced plans to trans@@ fer regulatory authority from the Financial Ser@@ vi@@ ces Au@@ th@@ ority (@@ FS@@ A@@ ) to the Bank of Eng@@ land.
But agreement about the regulatory role of central banks is not widely spread@@ .
In the United States, for example, there is recogni@@ tion of the importance of macro@@ -@@ p@@ ru@@ denti@@ al regul@@ ation, but not of giving this authority to the Federal Reser@@ ve.
The new@@ ly pass@@ ed US financi@@ al-@@ reform legisl@@ ation ent@@ ru@@ sts macro@@ -@@ p@@ ru@@ denti@@ al policy to a new Financial Stability O@@ versi@@ ght Counc@@ il.
That is go@@ od, but the US Treasury sec@@ retary will be the coun@@ c@@ il@@ ’s ch@@ air@@ man, and the F@@ ed, despite gain@@ ing some new power@@ s, will for the most part be only one of many member@@ s.
The head of the coun@@ cil is thus a political appoin@@ tee who ser@@ ves at the p@@ leas@@ ure of the presid@@ ent.
Rec@@ ent history shows that political appoin@@ te@@ es often fail to take c@@ oura@@ ge@@ ous or un@@ popular steps to stabili@@ ze the economy.
A modern US president certainly re@@ members how difficult it was to con@@ vin@@ ce voters to put him where he is, and is per@@ pet@@ ually campaig@@ ning to maintain appro@@ val rat@@ ings and to preser@@ ve his part@@ y’s prospec@@ ts in the next elec@@ tion.
The Treasury sec@@ retary is part of the presid@@ ent@@ ’s te@@ am@@ , and works next do@@ or to the Wh@@ ite Hous@@ e.
George W. Bush won the 2000 elec@@ tion, despite los@@ ing the popular vo@@ te.
In 200@@ 3, Bush ch@@ ose as his Treasury sec@@ retary John W. S@@ now, a ra@@ il@@ road president wh@@ o, as Bar@@ ron@@ ’s col@@ um@@ n@@ ist Al@@ an Ab@@ el@@ son put it, “@@ may not be the sharp@@ est k@@ ni@@ fe in the c@@ ab@@ in@@ et@@ .” S@@ now oblig@@ ed the president and gave un@@ ques@@ tioning support to his policies until leaving office in 200@@ 6, just before the crisis er@@ up@@ ted.
Un@@ der the new law, S@@ now would have been in char@@ ge of the stability of the entire US economy.
One them@@ e that Bush found res@@ on@@ ated with voters in his 2004 re-@@ election campaign was that of the “@@ owner@@ ship societ@@ y@@ .”
A successful economy, Bush argu@@ ed, requires that people learn to take responsibility for their ac@@ tions, and policies aimed at boo@@ sting home owner@@ ship would in@@ cul@@ c@@ ate this vir@@ tu@@ e on a broader sc@@ al@@ e.
That so@@ unded right to vo@@ ters, especially if it meant government policies that encoura@@ ged the emerging re@@ al-@@ est@@ ate bub@@ ble and made their investments in hom@@ es so@@ ar in valu@@ e.
S@@ now ech@@ o@@ ed his bo@@ s@@ s. “@@ The American economy is co@@ il@@ ed like a spr@@ ing and ready to go@@ ,” he ch@@ ir@@ p@@ ed in 200@@ 3.
Two years later, near the very hei@@ ght of the bub@@ bl@@ es in the equity and housing markets, he declared that, “@@ We can be p@@ leas@@ ed that the economy is on a good and sustainable pa@@ th@@ .”
But, to Bush’s credi@@ t, he also brought in B@@ en Bernank@@ e in 2006 as Fed Cha@@ ir@@ man@@ .
Not part of Bush’s te@@ am@@ , Bernank@@ e was protec@@ ted from political pressu@@ res by America’s long tradi@@ tion of respect for the F@@ ed@@ ’s indepen@@ dence.
The choice of Bernank@@ e, an accompli@@ shed sch@@ ol@@ ar, appar@@ ently reflec@@ ted Bush’s accep@@ t@@ ance of the public@@ ’s expec@@ tation of a fir@@ st-@@ rate appoin@@ te@@ e.
The same problems occ@@ ur in many other countries.
People who are cho@@ sen in part to win the next election often find their economic jud@@ g@@ ment constra@@ in@@ ed.
A news story in 2003 repor@@ ted, for example, that Australi@@ an Secretary to the Treasury K@@ en H@@ en@@ ry had war@@ ned of a “@@ housing bub@@ ble@@ ” ther@@ e, but then quickly tried to with@@ draw his com@@ ment, sa@@ ying that it was “@@ not for quo@@ tation outside of this ro@@ om@@ .”  @@ He did earlier this year finally pro@@ pose new tax policy to slow the still@@ -@@ continuing Australi@@ an housing bub@@ ble, but now he can@@ ’t get his government to imp@@ lement it.
By contrast, in recent decades central bank@@ ers in many countries have gradu@@ ally won accep@@ t@@ ance for the principle of independence from da@@ y-@@ to-@@ day political pres@@ sur@@ es.
The public in much of the world now under@@ stands that central bank@@ ers will be allowed to do their work without inter@@ ference from politici@@ ans.
There is a tradi@@ tion of the central bank@@ er as a world@@ ly philosop@@ her@@ , who stands up for long-term sensi@@ ble policy, and this tradi@@ tion makes it politically easier for central bank@@ ers to do the right th@@ ing.
In fact, while the world’s central banks did not see the current crisis coming and did not take steps before 2007 to re@@ lie@@ ve the pressu@@ res that led to it, they did re@@ act deci@@ si@@ vely and en@@ er@@ ge@@ tic@@ ally as the crisis un@@ fol@@ ded, with coordin@@ ated international ac@@ tion.
This was facilit@@ ated by the tradi@@ tion of political independence and cooperation that has developed over the years among central bank@@ ers.
The crisis has under@@ s@@ cor@@ ed the ut@@ most importance of macro@@ -@@ p@@ ru@@ denti@@ al regul@@ ation.
Although our central bank@@ ers are not perf@@ ect jud@@ ges of financial stabilit@@ y, they are still the people who are in the best political and institutional position to ensure it.
PR@@ A@@ G@@ U@@ E@@ : Identi@@ ty and sovereign@@ ty are often discus@@ sed nowad@@ ay@@ s.
But what do they actually mean@@ ?
Both probably consi@@ st of feel@@ ings that a community can only be its true self when it can be so without hin@@ d@@ ran@@ ce – in essen@@ ce, when a community can decide its own f@@ ate.
Toda@@ y’s talk about identi@@ ty and sovereign@@ ty is often rather g@@ lo@@ om@@ y.
Both are alle@@ ge@@ dly end@@ an@@ ger@@ ed@@ : by an EU that wi@@ sh@@ es to assi@@ mil@@ ate “@@ us@@ ” as much as possi@@ ble@@ ; by the European Commission with its standard@@ s; by NATO@@ , the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank@@ ; by the United Nation@@ s; by foreign capit@@ al@@ ; by Western ideologi@@ es; by Eastern ma@@ fi@@ as@@ ; by American influ@@ enc@@ e; by Asian or African immig@@ ration@@ ; and by G@@ od knows what el@@ se.
Some of these concerns may con@@ tain a rational cor@@ e.
Yet they all deri@@ ve from a traditional mis@@ conc@@ ep@@ tion – the belief that up@@ holding charac@@ ter, identi@@ ty or sovereign@@ ty is not princip@@ ally the task of a community or a people but is something left in the control of other@@ s; that is, left to those who would attempt to de@@ pri@@ ve “@@ us@@ ” of our identi@@ ty, or at least to weak@@ en it.
I do not thin@@ k, however, that the world’s main concern is to find ways to ro@@ b people of their identi@@ ty and sovereign@@ ty.
Res@@ p@@ ect for any nation@@ ’s uni@@ que character@@ ; the man@@ ner of its develop@@ ment@@ ; and, the degree to which a community deci@@ des its f@@ ate, is determined pri@@ mar@@ ily by those living within it.
How is this f@@ ate determin@@ ed@@ ?
It depends on whether a people close themselves off in hope that the various win@@ ds of this world will p@@ ass them by@@ ; or, whether a nation takes the opposi@@ te t@@ ack and conduc@@ ts itself as true in@@ hab@@ it@@ ants of this contin@@ ent and of this plan@@ et, that is, as people eng@@ aged with the world and who assu@@ me their share of responsibility for it.
All human@@ ity is faced by this crucial di@@ le@@ m@@ ma@@ : to sil@@ ently wat@@ ch a su@@ ici@@ d@@ al self-@@ pro@@ pul@@ sion of our civili@@ z@@ ation@@ ; or to become active particip@@ ants in the main@@ ten@@ ance of global public asset@@ s, including the most preci@@ ous one of all – our plan@@ et and its bio@@ sph@@ ere – of which we are a par@@ t.
But the conc@@ ept of community is also com@@ posed of con@@ cre@@ te th@@ ings.
It depend@@ s, for example, on whether the environment is n@@ ur@@ tu@@ re@@ d.
It depends on whether a people let their cities and to@@ w@@ ns become mar@@ red by a ban@@ al universal arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture de@@ vo@@ id of cre@@ ativ@@ ity and imag@@ in@@ ation.
Such bli@@ gh@@ ts are not imposed by the European Union or by global capital with its trans@@ national corpor@@ ations, or by evi@@ l for@@ eig@@ ner@@ s.
All of this physi@@ cal de@@ gra@@ d@@ ation – as it happ@@ ens – is accompli@@ shed with local con@@ sent and active local assi@@ st@@ ance.
In other wor@@ d@@ s: those who def@@ ile “@@ our@@ ” identi@@ ty are pri@@ mar@@ ily our@@ sel@@ ves – we who should be its protec@@ tors and gu@@ ardi@@ ans.
Wh@@ o is it that in@@ fest@@ s langu@@ age and con@@ vers@@ ation with c@@ lich@@ es, ill@@ -@@ structu@@ red syn@@ tax and ro@@ te ex@@ pres@@ sions that f@@ low min@@ d@@ less@@ ly from m@@ ou@@ th to m@@ ou@@ th and p@@ en to p@@ en?
Wh@@ o is responsible for the ster@@ ile langu@@ age of commer@@ ci@@ als seen on every w@@ all and tel@@ evi@@ sion, indeed, seen every@@ wher@@ e, and without which we appear to be unable to know even the time of da@@ y?
Ar@@ en@@ ’t these severe attacks on langu@@ age also ass@@ aul@@ ts on a ro@@ ot of our identi@@ ti@@ es?
And ar@@ en@@ ’t we who use them, quite willing@@ ly, also responsible for them@@ ?
L@@ et us go far@@ ther@@ : Wh@@ o allow@@ s young people to b@@ a@@ the from mor@@ ning ti@@ ll ni@@ ght in blo@@ od flow@@ ing on tel@@ evi@@ sion and mo@@ vi@@ e s@@ cre@@ ens, and yet are sanc@@ tim@@ oni@@ ous and ast@@ on@@ ished about the aggressi@@ ven@@ ess of the yo@@ ung@@ ?
Wh@@ o read@@ s all kin@@ ds of tra@@ sh and por@@ no@@ -@@ tra@@ sh@@ ?
These “@@ enter@@ tain@@ ment@@ s” are not fil@@ m@@ ed and publi@@ shed by bureauc@@ rats from B@@ rus@@ sel@@ s or by represent@@ atives of international institutions, foreign states or large international corpor@@ ations@@ : they are market@@ ed by citizens to fel@@ low citiz@@ ens.
Beh@@ in@@ d these visi@@ ble ass@@ aul@@ ts on identi@@ ty found in every industrial country, the post@@ communist countries confron@@ t other serious threats to both sovereign@@ ty and identi@@ ty.
O@@ ver the past ten years of economic transform@@ ation, uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able wealth has un@@ account@@ ably dis@@ appe@@ ared from banks and compani@@ es; billi@@ ons in taxes go un@@ pa@@ i@@ d.
F@@ e@@ w of those responsible have been brought to j@@ us@@ tic@@ e.
Perhaps worst of all, those who trans@@ fer@@ red money to tax ha@@ v@@ ens seem to enjo@@ y the sil@@ ent ad@@ mi@@ ration of the people of whom they have taken advan@@ ta@@ ge.
But wh@@ o, precis@@ el@@ y, are those who do not re@@ pay their deb@@ ts, and who are those who h@@ ire ass@@ as@@ sin@@ s to get ri@@ d of their credi@@ tor@@ s?
W@@ ho@@ , among those who should be ser@@ ving as model@@ s for other@@ s, that is, who among the leaders of political parti@@ es, den@@ ies his own financial mach@@ in@@ ations with a sm@@ ir@@ k@@ ?
Wh@@ o em@@ its into our political and public life the po@@ is@@ ons of dis@@ sen@@ sion, f@@ ou@@ l pla@@ y, e@@ go@@ ism, hat@@ red and en@@ v@@ y?
Wh@@ o – quite in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ously – is leading us to become ever more har@@ den@@ ed in our sensi@@ bili@@ ties and toward becoming increasingly acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the fact that everyone can li@@ e about everything and any@@ th@@ ing@@ ?
I repe@@ at@@ : if a nation@@ 's identi@@ ty is je@@ op@@ ardi@@ z@@ ed, it is placed in that position pri@@ mar@@ ily from with@@ in@@ ; it is placed in je@@ op@@ ard@@ y by choice – often the choic@@ es ex@@ pressed at the bal@@ lot bo@@ x – and out of neg@@ ligence or in@@ d@@ ol@@ ence.
Th@@ re@@ ats to identi@@ ty nowad@@ a@@ ys are pri@@ mar@@ ily not matters of dict@@ ates from out@@ si@@ de.
Tru@@ e, the blin@@ d pursu@@ it of prof@@ it is not the inv@@ en@@ tion of any one people.
Tru@@ e, that pursu@@ it is a tra@@ it which is immen@@ sely con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ous.
But it is also true that no@@ body can force anyone to take that cour@@ se.
If we really want it, if we all are prepared to ex@@ press the desire to preser@@ ve community and identi@@ ty by taking part in elections and by making the right choic@@ es, an open international environment and the advanced democratic cultu@@ res of our neighbor@@ s, fri@@ ends and allies con@@ stit@@ utes the best ground for adv@@ anc@@ ing a peop@@ le’s uni@@ qu@@ en@@ ess.
N@@ ow@@ ad@@ ay@@ s, any identi@@ ty can truly live and fl@@ ou@@ ris@@ h only if it bre@@ ath@@ es the free air of the world@@ ; if it defin@@ es itself against a back@@ ground of la@@ sting and living neighbor@@ ly relations with other identi@@ ti@@ es; and, if it confron@@ ts, in a dig@@ ni@@ fied man@@ n@@ er, both the ad@@ verse win@@ ds that b@@ low across today’s world and, perhaps more importantly, the ad@@ verse desi@@ res that come from with@@ in.
T@@ O@@ L@@ E@@ D@@ O@@ , Spain – Do@@ es the war in the C@@ au@@ cas@@ us her@@ ald the coming of Cold War II@@ ?
O@@ r is it a Russian inv@@ it@@ ation to the West to res@@ h@@ ap@@ e the global status qu@@ o that has prev@@ ail@@ ed since the end of Cold War I@@ ?
Russia’s military is certainly not f@@ it for a global confron@@ tation with the Wes@@ t.
Not only did Russian intel@@ ligence fail to cat@@ ch the coming Georgi@@ an attack on South Os@@ se@@ ti@@ a, but Russia’s elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic war@@ fare system and ill@@ -@@ equi@@ pped ground troops look@@ ed like out@@ d@@ ated Sovi@@ et@@ -@@ era re@@ lic@@ s.
Th@@ en again, a war does not have to disp@@ la@@ y state-@@ of@@ -@@ th@@ e-@@ art weapon@@ ry to con@@ v@@ ey a powerful political mes@@ sa@@ ge.
After all, America’s global lever@@ age is d@@ win@@ d@@ ling even as its army remains the most s@@ op@@ h@@ istic@@ ated military mach@@ ine in histor@@ y.
By show@@ ing that the United States has lost its mon@@ opol@@ y on the unilater@@ al use of forc@@ e, and by inv@@ ad@@ ing an American ally – which even the Soviet Union never dar@@ ed – Russia b@@ lat@@ antly challeng@@ ed the P@@ a@@ x Americ@@ an@@ a that emerg@@ ed from the US victory in the Cold War@@ .
The war in Georgi@@ a could not have happened if America had not mis@@ hand@@ led its global he@@ gemon@@ y so disa@@ stro@@ us@@ ly.
The US ent@@ ered a cal@@ am@@ it@@ ous war in Iraq, mis@@ sed more than one opportunity to eng@@ age Iran@@ 's revolution@@ ary regi@@ me, push@@ ed for un@@ ending expansion of NATO on@@ to the do@@ or@@ step of Russia, and hau@@ gh@@ ti@@ ly ignor@@ ed Russia’s protests against the dep@@ loy@@ ment of missi@@ le def@@ ens@@ es in Eastern Europe.
Un@@ der the cover of the “@@ war on terror@@ ,” the US played into Russia’s fear of en@@ cir@@ cle@@ ment through its military pen@@ et@@ ration into Central Asian countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, U@@ z@@ bek@@ ist@@ an, K@@ y@@ r@@ g@@ y@@ z@@ st@@ an, K@@ az@@ ak@@ h@@ st@@ an, and Ta@@ j@@ ik@@ ist@@ an.
In its qu@@ est to coun@@ ter what it se@@ es as a hosti@@ le US strategy of creating American “@@ Cub@@ as@@ ” on its do@@ or@@ step@@ , the Kremlin is promoting alli@@ ances with Ra@@ ú@@ l C@@ astro@@ ’s Cub@@ a and Hu@@ go Cháve@@ z@@ ’s Venezuel@@ a.
In the Middle East, Russia is doing everything to re@@ gain some of the fo@@ o@@ th@@ olds it had in the past with the a@@ im of sid@@ el@@ ining America as the sol@@ e global ac@@ tor in the region.
Syri@@ an President B@@ ash@@ ar al-@@ As@@ s@@ ad@@ ’s recent visit to Mosco@@ w is a transpar@@ ent mani@@ fest@@ ation of the potential for a renew@@ ed alli@@ ance.
Russia continues to place hur@@ d@@ les before American propos@@ als for sanctions on Iran, has signed with it la@@ v@@ ish energy contrac@@ ts, and is about to sell it advanced a@@ eri@@ al systems aimed at th@@ war@@ ting a possible Israeli or American attack@@ .
Likewise, the Russians have just er@@ as@@ ed much of Iraq@@ ’s debt and agreed lu@@ c@@ rative oil dri@@ ll@@ ing de@@ als.
One vic@@ ti@@ m of American post-@@ Cold War unilater@@ alism has been the transatlan@@ tic alli@@ ance.
The US drive to exp@@ and NATO is not shared by all its alli@@ es, and Europe is in no mo@@ od to follow in the fo@@ ot@@ steps of Georgi@@ a’s imp@@ ul@@ sive president and be dra@@ g@@ ged by the ex@@ -@@ Soviet Bal@@ tic states and Pol@@ and into a confron@@ tation with Russia.
Europe, dependent as it is on Russian energy supp@@ li@@ es, is not prepared for a new Cold W@@ ar, and its alternative to Russian oil – Iran – is not pal@@ at@@ able to the Americ@@ ans.
A return to a Cold War strategy is clearly not in the West@@ ’s interes@@ t.
Th@@ re@@ ats to ex@@ pe@@ l Russia from the G-@@ 8 or keep it out of the World Trade Organ@@ ization will only increase its sense of isol@@ ation, strengthen its author@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism, and push it into the role of a revolution@@ ary anti-@@ status qu@@ o power in the Soviet Uni@@ on’s old sph@@ ere of influence and be@@ y@@ on@@ d.
Russian min@@ ori@@ ties still wa@@ iting to be “@@ re@@ de@@ em@@ ed@@ ” in Ukra@@ ine, the Bal@@ tic states, and M@@ ol@@ do@@ v@@ a are potential trig@@ ger@@ s for Russia’s ne@@ o-@@ imperi@@ alism@@ . 
But, as a power bur@@ den@@ ed with too many domestic ill@@ s and a chron@@ ic sense of in@@ security along its vast and danger@@ ously de@@ popul@@ ated bor@@ ders, Russia cannot be interest@@ ed in a Cold War II@@ , ei@@ ther.
Its recent agreement with China on border dem@@ ar@@ c@@ ation not@@ with@@ stand@@ ing, Russia can never be assu@@ red of China’s ultim@@ ate inten@@ tions as a c@@ olo@@ ss@@ al power hung@@ ry for ra@@ w materi@@ als for its boom@@ ing economy and living space for its massive popul@@ ation.
As the war in the C@@ au@@ cas@@ us has show@@ n, the global economy does not offer a fo@@ ol@@ pro@@ of guarantee against war.
But it is one thing to take a calcul@@ ated ris@@ k, as the Russians did in righ@@ tly assum@@ ing that the West would not go to war over Georgi@@ a@@ ; it is another thing for Russia to je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze its c@@ olo@@ ss@@ al economic gains of recent years in an all-@@ out confron@@ tation with the Wes@@ t.
Indeed, the war in Georgi@@ a already has th@@ rown Russia into the most severe financial crisis since its vir@@ tual bankrup@@ t@@ cy in 199@@ 8@@ ; $@@ 1@@ 7 billion were lost in capital f@@ light in just one week@@ .
The Mosco@@ w stock exchange lost 1@@ 5% of its value in Au@@ gu@@ st, and Russia’s central bank forec@@ ast@@ s a 2@@ 5% decline in foreign investment this year.
Russia must seek genu@@ ine strategic partner@@ ship with the US, and the lat@@ ter must understand that, when exclu@@ ded and desp@@ is@@ ed, Russia can be a major global spo@@ il@@ er.
I@@ g@@ nor@@ ed and hum@@ ili@@ ated by the US since the Cold War en@@ ded, Russia needs integration into a new global order that respec@@ ts its interests as a res@@ urg@@ ent power, not an anti-@@ Western strategy of confron@@ t@@ ation.
For@@ ty years after the Si@@ x Da@@ y War peace between Israelis and Palestinians seems as dist@@ ant as ever@@ .
Israel still ref@@ uses to accept the new Palestinian national unity government as a negoti@@ ating partn@@ er because Hamas is part of that government.
What is the cause of this seem@@ ing par@@ adox@@ ?
Is there any hop@@ e?
The Palestinian government is un@@ ited administ@@ rati@@ vel@@ y, but divi@@ ded politi@@ call@@ y.
The Palestinians have one government with two policies.
Politi@@ call@@ y, Palest@@ ine@@ ’s Prime Minister Is@@ ma@@ il H@@ ani@@ ye@@ h remains against recogni@@ zing Israel and respec@@ ting the existing agreem@@ ents.
He declared that he is for the continu@@ ation of resist@@ ance in all form@@ s.
What kind of guarantee of a good fa@@ ith effort to reach a peace agreement can come from such a st@@ anc@@ e?
That is the question the European Union needs to ask itself as it deb@@ ates whether to res@@ um@@ e providing financial aid to the Palestinian Au@@ th@@ or@@ ity.
The EU should make it clear to Hamas that the Union is not going to finance ter@@ ror and is not going to finance a ref@@ us@@ al to make peac@@ e.
If the Palestinians want to have European help – which I support comple@@ tel@@ y – it must be ready to make peac@@ e, not to break peac@@ e.
After all, it is not Hamas as a party that is objec@@ tion@@ able@@ ; what is objec@@ tion@@ able are the politics and policies which Hamas pursu@@ es.
We have nothing against Ham@@ as@@ ; we are against their bel@@ li@@ ger@@ ent policies, which service in government has not chan@@ ge@@ d.
There was a time when the P@@ L@@ O held posi@@ tions that were the same as those of Ham@@ as.
Th@@ en the P@@ L@@ O chan@@ ge@@ d.
If the current Palestinian leadership changes its posi@@ tion, there will be no problem from our si@@ de.
We will have nothing against negoti@@ ations.
We are for negoti@@ ations.
We are for the “@@ two-@@ state solu@@ tion@@ .”
We accept the Middle East “@@ road ma@@ p@@ .”
What we are against is terror@@ .
Wh@@ ere we cannot agre@@ e, however, is on a “@@ right of retur@@ n@@ ” for Palestini@@ ans.
If such a right were recogni@@ z@@ ed, there would be a Palestinian majority instead of a Jewish maj@@ or@@ ity, which would mean the end of the Jewish state.
This is a demograph@@ ic@@ , not a religi@@ ous, ques@@ tion@@ : an Arab state is where the Ara@@ bs are the maj@@ or@@ ity, and the Jewish state is where the Je@@ ws are the maj@@ or@@ ity.
Indeed, the “@@ right of retur@@ n@@ ” contra@@ dic@@ ts the very idea of a two-@@ state solu@@ tion, as it would mean one state – a Palestinian state.
No@@ body in Israel will accept this.
But there are other problems in the region that Israel – and the world – must fac@@ e.
The Palestini@@ an@@ s’ current unity government resul@@ ted from Saudi medi@@ ation, which came in response mainly to Iran’s ambi@@ tion to increase its influ@@ ence, not only in Iraq, but also in Leban@@ on, Gaz@@ a, and the West Bank@@ .
Of course, that issue is comple@@ tel@@ y outside Israel’s contro@@ l.
The ongoing fight in the Muslim world between Sun@@ nis and Shi@@ ’@@ a rec@@ all@@ s the struggle between Pro@@ test@@ ants and C@@ atholi@@ cs in se@@ v@@ ent@@ e@@ enth@@ -@@ century Europe.
So it is little won@@ der that the Saudi@@ s, Jord@@ ani@@ ans, Egypti@@ ans, and the Gul@@ f states are seeking to res@@ ist Iran’s he@@ gemon@@ ic ambi@@ tions in the region.
Nevertheless, the stak@@ es are far higher than in the se@@ v@@ ent@@ e@@ enth century, because Iran repres@@ ents a threat that combin@@ es a fan@@ ati@@ c religi@@ on with a determin@@ ation to acqu@@ ire nuclear weapon@@ s.
Indeed, Iran is the only country that open@@ ly decl@@ ar@@ es its desire to destro@@ y another member of the United Nation@@ s.
That is a threat that every country is oblig@@ ed to take seri@@ ous@@ ly.
When a country’s president deli@@ vers cra@@ z@@ y spe@@ ech@@ es, den@@ ies the Holocau@@ st, and does not hi@@ de his ambi@@ tion to control the Middle East, who can guarantee that the threat is not seri@@ ous@@ ?
The issue is not one of restor@@ ing nuclear “@@ balanc@@ e” to the Middle East, as Iran’s leaders maintain@@ .
Fir@@ st of all, Israel does not thre@@ aten any@@ bo@@ d@@ y.
Israel never said that it wants to destro@@ y Iran@@ ; Israel never open@@ ly proc@@ la@@ im@@ ed that it would en@@ rich ur@@ ani@@ um and build nuclear bom@@ bs in order to destro@@ y another country.
On the contrary, Israel has said that it will not be the first to use nuclear weapons in the Middle East@@ .
But that does not mean that we can afford to ignor@@ e an obvious threat from countries that want to destro@@ y us.
Despite the current un@@ favor@@ able situ@@ ation, the path to stabili@@ zing the Middle East still lead@@ s through jo@@ int economic projec@@ ts.
Even now, Israel is plann@@ ing to build a new “@@ cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or of peac@@ e@@ ,” which will com@@ pri@@ se the Jord@@ ani@@ ans, the Palestini@@ ans, and us.
Wi@@ thin the framework of this projec@@ t, we are seeking to halt the de@@ hy@@ dra@@ tion of the De@@ ad Se@@ a, build a jo@@ int air@@ port and a jo@@ int water net@@ work with Jord@@ an, and develop tou@@ ris@@ m infrastructu@@ re, at a cost of up to $@@ 5 billi@@ on.
We have the don@@ ors, so there is no shor@@ tage of money to finance our effor@@ ts, wh@@ ich, I am sure, will be re@@ aliz@@ ed.
Israel wants – indeed, des@@ per@@ ately needs – peace and stability in the Middle East, and we will continue to do everything in our power to achieve it.
But we cannot reach that goal al@@ one, much less negoti@@ ate with those whose idea of a stable and peaceful Middle East is one that has no place for Israel.
W@@ AS@@ HI@@ NG@@ T@@ ON@@ , D@@ C – According to Vol@@ ta@@ i@@ re, the Rom@@ an Emp@@ ire fell “@@ because all things fall@@ .”
It is hard to argue with this as a general stat@@ ement about decl@@ ine@@ : nothing la@@ sts for@@ ever@@ .
But it is also not very us@@ eful@@ .
In think@@ ing, for example, about American pre@@ domin@@ ance in the world today, it would be ni@@ ce to know when it will decl@@ ine, and whether the United States can do anything to post@@ p@@ one the inevit@@ able.
Con@@ temporary com@@ ment@@ ers des@@ pa@@ i@@ red of the Rom@@ an Emp@@ ire for several hund@@ red years before it finally collap@@ s@@ ed.
C@@ ould America find its way to a similar exten@@ sion@@ ?
In terms of providing an essential structure for discus@@ sion of this proble@@ m, Ar@@ vin@@ d Sub@@ ra@@ mani@@ an’s new book@@ , E@@ cli@@ p@@ se@@ : Li@@ ving in the S@@ ha@@ do@@ w of China’s Economic D@@ omin@@ ance, is a major contribu@@ tion.
(@@ F@@ ul@@ l disc@@ lo@@ su@@ re@@ : Sub@@ ra@@ mani@@ an and I are colle@@ agu@@ es at the Pe@@ ter@@ son Institu@@ te for International Econom@@ ic@@ s, and we have worked together on other issu@@ es@@ .)
In particul@@ ar, Sub@@ ra@@ mani@@ an develop@@ s an inde@@ x of economic domin@@ ance that should become a focus of con@@ vers@@ ation any@@ where that people want to think about changes in world economic leader@@ ship.
There is no need to know any economics in order to be fas@@ c@@ in@@ ated by this book@@ : it is about power, p@@ ure and simp@@ le.
The basic fac@@ ts are in@@ contro@@ ver@@ ti@@ ble.
The United King@@ dom was the world’s domin@@ ant economic power from the rise of industri@@ alization in the early n@@ ine@@ te@@ enth century.
But it lost its pre@@ domin@@ ance and was gradu@@ ally ec@@ li@@ p@@ sed by the US, wh@@ ich, at least since 194@@ 5, has been the un@@ disp@@ uted leader among market@@ -@@ based economies.
The US sur@@ pass@@ ed the U@@ K in terms of industrial production as early as the end of the n@@ ine@@ te@@ enth century, but that was not enough to ti@@ p the bal@@ ance.
Economic pre@@ domin@@ ance shif@@ ted only when the U@@ K ra@@ n large current-account deficits during World War@@ s I and II – the country had to bor@@ row heav@@ ily in order to finance its war effor@@ t, and impor@@ ts were significantly higher than export@@ s.
Mu@@ ch of the world’s gold reserves ended up in the hands of the US.
This helped undermin@@ e the role of the British po@@ und internation@@ ally and cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ ted the US dollar to the fore – particularly after the Bre@@ tt@@ on Wo@@ ods con@@ ference in 194@@ 4, at which it was agreed that countries would hold their reserves in dollars as well as g@@ ol@@ d.
More rec@@ ently, however, it has been the Americ@@ an@@ s’ turn consist@@ ently to run large current-account defic@@ its, bu@@ ying more from the rest of the world than they ear@@ n by s@@ elling goods and services ab@@ road@@ .
On this di@@ men@@ sion, the US seems dest@@ ined to repe@@ at the mist@@ ake of the Briti@@ sh@@ .
At the same time, emerg@@ ing-@@ market countries’ per capita income has ri@@ sen –@@  @@ as has their international ro@@ le.
In particul@@ ar, China has followed a strategy in the past decade or so that ent@@ ail@@ s running large current-account surpl@@ uses and building up foreign-@@ exchange reser@@ ves, which are now repor@@ ted to be in exc@@ ess of $@@ 3 trilli@@ on.
Indeed, Sub@@ ra@@ mani@@ an’s most pro@@ voc@@ ative argument is that China has already sur@@ pass@@ ed the US in terms of economic domin@@ ance – but we have not yet w@@ ok@@ en up to this new re@@ ality.
The story is fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating and well t@@ old@@ ; but there is still a great deal worth argu@@ ing.
For example, did the British decline because the US could not be stopp@@ ed, or because of problems within the British Emp@@ ire and at hom@@ e?
A few years ago, some regar@@ ded Japan as having over@@ taken the US.
Europe also was sup@@ pos@@ edly v@@ ying for global economic domin@@ ance.
Now any such claims would seem pre@@ po@@ ster@@ ous.
In both cas@@ es, the credit system go@@ t out of contro@@ l, with too much lending to the private sector in 198@@ 0’s Japan and excessive government borrowing during the 200@@ 0’s in the euroz@@ one.
Similarly, it remains un@@ clear that the Chinese development path will remain smo@@ o@@ th.
Fi@@ x@@ ed investment in China is close to 50% of GDP – which must be a world rec@@ or@@ d.
C@@ redi@@ t to state firms and to households continues to grow rapid@@ ly.
Is@@ n’t this a ver@@ sion of exac@@ tly what der@@ ail@@ ed Japanese grow@@ th@@ ?
On the key issue of being able to issue a “@@ reser@@ ve curren@@ cy@@ ” that investors and governments want to hol@@ d, Sub@@ ra@@ mani@@ an is correc@@ t that China has many of the pr@@ er@@ equi@@ si@@ tes in plac@@ e.
But it still lack@@ s some key el@@ em@@ ents, including ful@@ l@@ y-@@ f@@ led@@ ged property righ@@ ts.
If you wor@@ ry about getting your money out of a country when times turn t@@ ough@@ , China is not an attrac@@ tive place to hold your reser@@ ves.
Ex@@ ternal challenges do sometimes bring down states.
But, more frequ@@ ently, the big problems are internal – the regime cannot deli@@ ver growth, its legitimacy f@@ ad@@ es, and people start to head for the ex@@ its (or at least get their money out@@ ).
If the US is ec@@ li@@ p@@ sed any time so@@ on, this will more likely be due to its loss of social co@@ h@@ esi@@ on and its dy@@ sf@@ unc@@ tional politics.
China might well step in to f@@ ill that v@@ ac@@ u@@ um, but that is quite different from being able to el@@ bo@@ w America asi@@ de.
PAR@@ I@@ S – With the deep@@ ening of the economic crisis and the prospect of another recession lo@@ om@@ ing large on the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on, growing social inequality has become an increasingly urg@@ ent issu@@ e.
How does one rein@@ force a sense of solidar@@ ity and responsibility within a countr@@ y?
Wh@@ o will protect the weak@@ est@@ ?
As I pon@@ der this issu@@ e, I am remin@@ ded of a debate that I had more than ten years ago in Ber@@ lin with the German the@@ ologi@@ an H@@ ans K@@ ün@@ g and American and Asian particip@@ ant@@ s.
The subject was “@@ Glob@@ alization and Eth@@ ic@@ s” – speci@@ fic@@ ally, a compar@@ is@@ on of the ways that Europe, the United States and Asia protect the most fragi@@ le members of their respec@@ tive socie@@ ties.
All of the particip@@ ants agreed that in Europe the state tradition@@ ally fill@@ ed the role played by private ph@@ il@@ an@@ tro@@ p@@ y in the US and by the family in Asi@@ a.
But we all ha@@ st@@ ened to ad@@ d that no model was “@@ pu@@ re@@ ,” i@@ .@@ e@@ ., the family was no longer what it used to be in Asia, the state was pla@@ ying a big@@ ger role than expected in America, and it was often under@@ per@@ form@@ ing in Europe.

Re@@ ality has become even more complic@@ ated since th@@ en: the fam@@ il@@ y’s role continues to decline in Asi@@ a@@ ; ph@@ il@@ an@@ tro@@ p@@ y, despite a few extra@@ ordin@@ arily gener@@ ous individu@@ als, has more than met its limits in Americ@@ a@@ ; and, with the possible excep@@ tion of the Nor@@ di@@ c countries, the state in Europe, over@@ bur@@ den@@ ed by debt, no longer has the means or the will to sh@@ oul@@ der new responsi@@ bili@@ ties.
So who will take on the responsibility to protect the weak@@ est if n@@ one of these three ac@@ tors can do it proper@@ ly@@ ?
Ar@@ e we head@@ ing toward a world un@@ ited by shared in@@ comp@@ et@@ ence and in@@ adequ@@ ac@@ y?
In the Western world, the poorest are the worst affec@@ ted by economic stag@@ nation@@ .
But, in rapidly growing emerg@@ ing-@@ market countries, the rich tend to close their ey@@ es to the suff@@ ering of the poor@@ es@@ t, exc@@ ept when they feel threat@@ ened by the risk of political up@@ he@@ a@@ val@@ , as in, say, Saudi Arabi@@ a.
In fact, weal@@ thy eli@@ tes in emerging countries live in a state of den@@ i@@ al towards their po@@ or, liter@@ ally ignor@@ ing them.
Brazi@@ l and India are particularly stri@@ king in this regar@@ d.
Economic growth is necess@@ ary, but not suffici@@ ent@@ : a strong sense of social responsibility is needed as well.
It would be ab@@ sur@@ d to condem@@ n, as some do@@ , globalization as the main and only cul@@ pri@@ t in the ero@@ sion of traditional sources of support for the poor@@ .
Glob@@ alization is above all a con@@ tex@@ t, an environ@@ ment, even if the consequences of the first major financial and economic crisis of the global age will further deep@@ en the gap between the very rich and the very poor@@ .
But globalization makes the weak@@ est among us more visi@@ ble, and therefore makes the absence of social justice more un@@ accep@@ t@@ able.
A world of much greater transpar@@ ency and inter@@ depen@@ den@@ cy cre@@ ates new responsi@@ bili@@ ties for the rich@@ .
Or@@ , more precis@@ el@@ y, it makes the old responsibility to protect the weak@@ est both more difficult and more urg@@ ent.
In a world of increasing comp@@ lex@@ ity, perhaps what is needed are simple solu@@ tions.
One could follow@@ , for example, A@@ dam S@@ mi@@ th@@ ’s principle of compar@@ ative advan@@ ta@@ ge@@ : what Europe does best is the state, while Asia still reli@@ es on the family and the US continues to focus on individual initi@@ ativ@@ e.
The problem is that in a world of universal ben@@ ch@@ mark@@ ing, the legitimacy of solu@@ tions will stem more than ever from their cultural accep@@ t@@ ability and their effici@@ enc@@ y.
In Western Europe, for example, the call for sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce from all citizens in order to resol@@ ve the debt crisis r@@ uns up against a ling@@ ering perc@@ ep@@ tion that not all will contribute equ@@ ally, and that social inequality will be exac@@ erb@@ ated by auster@@ ity.
R@@ est@@ or@@ ing growth in the short term while addres@@ sing debt problems in the medi@@ um and long term may well be the only v@@ ali@@ d response to the crisis.
But it will not work, in Europe or elsewher@@ e, without a much greater empha@@ sis on social j@@ us@@ tic@@ e.
While some of the very rich comp@@ la@@ in, as War@@ ren Bu@@ ff@@ et@@ t did rec@@ ently, that they do not pay enough tax@@ es, the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed gener@@ o@@ si@@ ty of these happ@@ y few – who want to save capitalism and liber@@ alism – is unlikely to be em@@ ul@@ ated by the new rich in the emerging countries, much less by the rich elsewher@@ e.
L@@ et@@ ’s be realisti@@ c@@ : people like Bu@@ ff@@ et@@ t and Bill G@@ ates have very few fol@@ lower@@ s even among the very rich in the US.
And can Asian societies really revi@@ ve an effective sense of family responsi@@ bilit@@ y?
Glob@@ alization does appear to have weak@@ ened cultural differences no@@ tic@@ e@@ ably in the past deca@@ de.
But, when it comes to the protection of the weak@@ est and the struggle against rising social in@@ j@@ us@@ tic@@ e, perhaps “@@ global dec@@ ul@@ tu@@ ration@@ ” cre@@ ates an opportunity to comb@@ ine the best of what remains in particular tradi@@ tions.
Perhaps countries should seek to b@@ ase their soci@@ al-@@ welfare systems on a new syn@@ th@@ es@@ is of the state, the fam@@ il@@ y, and ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ ro@@ p@@ y.
LOND@@ ON@@ : The g@@ low of optim@@ ism at the European Uni@@ on@@ 's H@@ el@@ sink@@ i summit last mon@@ th, when EU leaders decided to ex@@ tend membership negotiations to all ten candidate countries from Central and Eastern Europe, pl@@ us Mal@@ ta and C@@ yp@@ rus@@ , is f@@ ad@@ ing fa@@ st.
It has now become c@@ r@@ y@@ st@@ al clear that enlar@@ gement is going to be a very difficult proc@@ ess@@ : difficult to negoti@@ ate, and just as difficul@@ t, perh@@ ap@@ s, to sell to the vo@@ ters.
The predic@@ ament can be ex@@ pressed in stark term@@ s: Wh@@ o Will P@@ ay the Pri@@ ce of En@@ lar@@ ge@@ ment@@ ?
En@@ lar@@ gement will not be cost@@ -@@ fre@@ e: there will be lo@@ ser@@ s, as well as winn@@ ers.
But the common di@@ lemm@@ a facing all sides in this negoti@@ ation, the ins as well as the out@@ s, is to make s@@ ure that there are not too many lo@@ ser@@ s in any one country.
O@@ ther@@ wise, enlar@@ gement simply will not get past the vo@@ ters.
The most immediate mani@@ fest@@ ation of this predic@@ ament is the European Uni@@ on@@ 's Com@@ m@@ on A@@ gri@@ cultural Poli@@ cy.
This policy has long been a bur@@ den, both on EU consu@@ mer@@ s, because it has kept food prices high@@ , and on EU taxpay@@ ers, because the sub@@ sid@@ y to far@@ mer@@ s@@ ' in@@ comes costs the Union some e@@ (@@ Euro@@ ) 4@@ 1@@ b@@ n every year (@@ about $@@ 4@@ 0@@ b@@ n@@ ), or around half of the total EU budge@@ t.
But it has been part of the core bar@@ gain which has kept the union toge@@ ther.
On pu@@ rely economic ground@@ s, subsi@@ dis@@ ing EU farm@@ ers has no justi@@ fic@@ ation, and it is an increasing an@@ om@@ al@@ y in a world of global markets and international competi@@ tion.
At the start of the Com@@ m@@ on Mark@@ et, it was the political price insi@@ sted on by France, a major agricultural country, as the condi@@ tion for opening the French market to German industrial good@@ s.
Today, that bar@@ gain has lost most of its origin@@ al justi@@ fic@@ ation.
France is now an immen@@ sely rich and powerful industrial countr@@ y; and though it is still one of the world's great food produc@@ ers, its far@@ m population has sh@@ ri@@ v@@ ell@@ ed from around 3@@ 0% of the total population after World War II to around 5% today.
Most EU government@@ s, including the Fren@@ ch, now reco@@ g@@ nis@@ e that the CA@@ P must be reform@@ ed, if only because of international pressure from other fo@@ od@@ -@@ expor@@ ting countries.
And in recent years, the EU has at least started to reduce the market support prices of some fo@@ od@@ s, while compens@@ ating farm@@ ers by making direct income supp@@ lement pay@@ ments inste@@ ad.
The troub@@ le is that the candidate countries now seeking membership are ke@@ en to get their share of the CA@@ P gra@@ v@@ y.
The six fron@@ t-@@ running countries (@@ C@@ ze@@ ch Republi@@ c, Est@@ oni@@ a, Hung@@ ary, Pol@@ and, S@@ lo@@ ven@@ ia and C@@ yp@@ rus@@ ) recently sub@@ mit@@ ted position pap@@ ers to the EU dem@@ anding that their far@@ m sec@@ tors should particip@@ ate fully in the CA@@ P from Da@@ y 1, and that their farm@@ ers should get all the benef@@ its, including income support pay@@ ments.
It is not clear that this opening position is wise, in economic term@@ s.
One social justi@@ fication for the CA@@ P is to prevent too large a gap between rural and industrial in@@ comes in the existing EU.
But all in@@ comes in the candidate countries are much lower than those in the EU, and if EU membership were to give a sud@@ den up@@ ward sho@@ ve to rural in@@ comes in Central Europe, it could be quite destabili@@ sing for social relations ther@@ e.
Moreover, it might also seri@@ ously dist@@ ort economic development, by attrac@@ ting excessive investment into agri@@ cultu@@ re.
Nor is it clear that this opening position is p@@ ru@@ dent in negoti@@ ating term@@ s.
If all the benefits of the CA@@ P were paid in full in all the six fron@@ t run@@ ner@@ s, the cost to the EU budget could be an ex@@ tr@@ a e@@ 6@@ b@@ n a year, and virtually all of that would have to be paid by existing member states, because they are so much rich@@ er.
But they have made no provi@@ sion for this kind of spend@@ ing, and are unlikely to agree to it.
One solution mo@@ o@@ ted by the Commission as a way of fin@@ essing the problem is to have a long transition period between membership of the EU, and full particip@@ ation in the CA@@ P@@ .
But the position pap@@ ers of the candidate countries exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly rule out this del@@ a@@ ying tac@@ tic@@ .
The far@@ m policy pu@@ zz@@ le will be followed by a similar predic@@ ament over EU regional and social policies.
By defin@@ ition these funds now go mainly to the poor@@ er parts of the EU.
Can@@ did@@ ate countries, however, are poor@@ er still@@ , so the full app@@ lic@@ ation of these regional policies would call for large ex@@ tr@@ a bud@@ get@@ ary trans@@ f@@ ers to Central and Eastern Europe.
At issue here is not mainly justice and mor@@ ality.
Of course, justice and mor@@ ality come into it, and these emo@@ tive b@@ ann@@ ers will no doubt be wa@@ ved by candidate countries during the negoti@@ ations.
But these are not likely to be the deci@@ sive consider@@ ations.
The first deci@@ sive consider@@ ation will be the oper@@ ational fe@@ asi@@ bility of the negoti@@ ation proc@@ ess, which means stri@@ king a politically accep@@ table balance between winn@@ ers and lo@@ ser@@ s throughout the enlar@@ ged Union.
It is difficult to over-@@ state what a difficult task that may turn out to be. R@@ em@@ em@@ ber, it only needs the voters of one member state to say No@@ , and the whole process fail@@ s.
The second consider@@ ation is the future arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture of the enlar@@ ged EU.
Po@@ st@@ pon@@ ing access to the CA@@ P may seem a par@@ tial solution to this problem@@ ; but it is also a par@@ tial step towards creating a two-@@ ti@@ er Union.
Given the immen@@ se disp@@ ari@@ ties in economic and other development, between the EU and the candidate countries, it may be deb@@ at@@ able whether it will be possible to create a un@@ it@@ ary or one-@@ ti@@ er Union with 2@@ 7-@@ pl@@ us countries.
But if not, what will be the arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture of this enlar@@ ged EU@@ ?
Unfortunately, this is a question which the member states have not thought ab@@ out, and appar@@ ently do not wish to think ab@@ out.
S@@ I@@ NG@@ A@@ P@@ OR@@ E – Barack Obama’s election comes at a moment when a new b@@ it of conventional wis@@ dom is con@@ ge@@ al@@ ing.
It concerns the end of America’s global domin@@ anc@@ e@@ . @@  
Tru@@ e, fre@@ e@@ whe@@ el@@ ing Americ@@ an-@@ style capitalism has not acqu@@ it@@ ted itself pro@@ ud@@ ly of lat@@ e.
And America’s military sup@@ eri@@ ority has not pro@@ ved all that us@@ eful in accompli@@ sh@@ ing American end@@ s.
But who may p@@ ick up the s@@ lack in providing global leader@@ ship@@ ?
The un@@ com@@ for@@ table answer that Obama is likely to confron@@ t is th@@ is@@ : no@@ bo@@ d@@ y.
America may be dam@@ age@@ d, but no re@@ plac@@ ement is on off@@ er.
Europe is self-@@ ab@@ sor@@ be@@ d, focused on creating whatever kind of enti@@ ty it ends up deci@@ ding to be.
China’s standard response to any sug@@ ges@@ tion that it exerc@@ ise global leadership is to hi@@ de ben@@ e@@ ath its vast internal agenda and p@@ lead pover@@ ty.
No other country comes close to having either the capacity or the ambi@@ tion.
In the face of the famili@@ ar lit@@ any of des@@ per@@ ate global problems – not just financial inst@@ abilit@@ y, but also climate change, energy in@@ security, potential pan@@ dem@@ ic@@ s, terror@@ ism, and the spread of weapons of mass destruc@@ tion – the prospect of a ru@@ d@@ der@@ less world is more than al@@ arm@@ ing.
What is to be don@@ e?
And by wh@@ om@@ ?
Given that the United States has not been pla@@ ying much of a leadership role on many of these issues rec@@ ently, it is worth taking a look at what happ@@ ens when no one country exerc@@ is@@ es effective leader@@ ship.
One set of answer@@ s might seem appar@@ ent from the collapse of international trade negotiations and the un@@ ra@@ vel@@ ing international system to control the spread of nuclear weapon@@ s. Th@@ ings can certainly get gri@@ m.
But that is not the whole stor@@ y@@ . 
To see wh@@ y, consider climate change.
It is now clear that avo@@ iding c@@ atastroph@@ ic climate change requires dramatic and rapid reduc@@ tions in green@@ hous@@ e-@@ gas emis@@ sions, cuts that would lower annual emissions to 8@@ 0% below 1990 levels by 20@@ 50@@ .
Yet emissions are not just ris@@ ing, but acceler@@ at@@ ing.
The coming recession may stem their growth tempor@@ ar@@ il@@ y, but only s@@ ligh@@ tl@@ y.
The necessary reduc@@ tions imp@@ ly a rapid and radical transform@@ ation of industri@@ al, energ@@ y, and land@@ -@@ use systems around the world.
What are governments doing about th@@ is@@ ?
S@@ up@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly, by Dec@@ ember 2009 they will agree on a new treaty to set limits on emis@@ sions.
But the prospec@@ ts that an agreement will be reached in Copen@@ hagen in Dec@@ ember 2009 are close to ni@@ l.
The new Obama administration will have only a few months to develop mean@@ ing@@ ful propos@@ als that can win domestic suppor@@ t, and will be pre@@ occup@@ ied with the after@@ mat@@ h of the current financial deb@@ ac@@ le and the Iraq war.
Europe is push@@ ing for ambi@@ tious targe@@ ts but is having troub@@ le with its own v@@ est@@ ed interest@@ s.
The large emerging countries, although they will suff@@ er dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately from wil@@ der we@@ a@@ ther and rising se@@ a level@@ s, show little interest in pi@@ ck@@ ing up the s@@ lack@@ .
Ne@@ goti@@ ation wat@@ ch@@ ers term the current Americ@@ an-@@ Chinese d@@ ance of mut@@ ual blam@@ e a su@@ ici@@ de p@@ ac@@ t.
In shor@@ t, the process is a m@@ ess.
This is hardly surpri@@ s@@ ing.
An inter@@ -@@ government@@ al system that falls ap@@ art under the challenges of trade negotiations and prolifer@@ ation threats is unlikely to ma@@ ster the deep comp@@ lex@@ ity and multi@@ tu@@ d@@ in@@ ous v@@ est@@ ed interests that the issue of climate change ent@@ ail@@ s.
Tradi@@ tional diplom@@ acy will at best de@@ vis@@ e a fac@@ e-@@ saving but mean@@ ing@@ less acc@@ ord next year.
In many are@@ as, fru@@ stration with inter@@ -@@ government@@ al in@@ transi@@ gence and in@@ comp@@ et@@ ence has sp@@ ark@@ ed extra@@ ordinary innov@@ ation by non-@@ government@@ al organiz@@ ations, corpor@@ ations, and ordinary people.
Priv@@ ate organizations such as the For@@ est S@@ te@@ war@@ d@@ ship Council and the Mar@@ ine S@@ te@@ war@@ d@@ ship Council provide and, increas@@ ing@@ ly, imp@@ lement environmental standards where inter@@ -@@ government@@ al action has fai@@ led.
Priv@@ ate ac@@ tors from found@@ ations to p@@ har@@ mac@@ eu@@ tical corpor@@ ations to NG@@ O@@ s are ac@@ tively experi@@ ment@@ ing with alternative ways to t@@ ack@@ le trans@@ national health challen@@ ges.
O@@ ften governments are part of these experi@@ ments – but they are not necess@@ arily the dri@@ ver@@ s, and progress does not depend on sig@@ ning tre@@ ati@@ es.
Indeed, there are many ways to put matters on the global agenda@@ , as shown by B@@ on@@ o@@ ’s campaig@@ ns on African development and Al G@@ ore@@ ’s on climate change.
A@@ gre@@ ements about how to make things better already frequ@@ ently include NG@@ O@@ s and corpor@@ ations in various capac@@ i@@ ties – and sometimes exclu@@ de governments al@@ toge@@ ther.
Priv@@ ate groups using everything from sat@@ el@@ li@@ te ima@@ ger@@ y (@@ as in for@@ est@@ r@@ y@@ ) to the un@@ official equi@@ valent of on-@@ si@@ te in@@ spec@@ tions (@@ as in human righ@@ ts@@ ) monit@@ or who is ab@@ iding by – or viol@@ ating – what standard of behavi@@ or.
While en@@ forc@@ ement in the co@@ er@@ ci@@ ve sense remains the dom@@ ain of states, co@@ er@@ ci@@ ve en@@ forc@@ ement is r@@ are even when it comes to inter@@ -@@ government@@ al agreem@@ ents.
W@@ he@@ ther countries ab@@ ide by agreements has far more to do with international proc@@ esses of persu@@ a@@ sion, soci@@ aliz@@ ation, and capac@@ it@@ y-@@ building – and those can be done by anyone with a good argum@@ ent.
The big question today is whether all these alternative approach@@ es can ad@@ d up to more than a b@@ it of des@@ per@@ ate tin@@ k@@ ering around the ed@@ ges.
Stand@@ ard internation@@ al-@@ relations thinking does not even enter@@ tain the ques@@ tion, and those conventional ways of se@@ eing the world have blin@@ ded us to looking at this crucial ques@@ tion.
As a result, we do not yet know the answer@@ .
D@@ at@@ a remain scar@@ ce.
There are hundreds of global public-@@ private partner@@ ships working on various global ill@@ s – but few have been exam@@ ined to see what good they do@@ .
The mis@@ h@@ mas@@ h of initi@@ ativ@@ es, ac@@ tor@@ s, campaig@@ n@@ s, and appe@@ als cre@@ ates opportunities for major progress – and mass con@@ fu@@ sion@@ . 
If there is to be real progress toward more effective and efficient global governance that can address the unpreced@@ ented challenges posed by climate change and the rest of the global agenda@@ , we must do much more than look for an easy re@@ plac@@ ement for American he@@ gemon@@ y.
We must fig@@ ure out how to make sense of this enormous diversi@@ ty of ways of saving the world.
The top pri@@ ority for the European Union at the beginning of the twent@@ y first century must be the histor@@ ic project conc@@ e@@ aled ben@@ e@@ ath the rather bor@@ ing la@@ bel of ‘@@ enlar@@ ge@@ ment@@ ’@@ .
The pri@@ ze is something that has never been achieved in European histor@@ y: the building of a liberal order that em@@ bra@@ ces the whole contin@@ ent.
To press on with this is now more vital than ever - and more difficul@@ t.
It is more difficult because public opinion in core countries of the Union, especially Germany and France, and in leading app@@ lic@@ ant countries, such as Pol@@ and and the C@@ ze@@ ch Republi@@ c, is increasingly sc@@ ep@@ tical about the process.
The electoral success of J@@ ör@@ g Hai@@ der in Au@@ stri@@ a has shown how effectively populi@@ st politicians can explo@@ it fear@@ s of opening to the e@@ ast@@ .
En@@ lar@@ gement now seems likely to be a con@@ ten@@ tious issue in the German parliamentary elec@@ tions, and perhaps also the French presidential elec@@ tion, both due in 200@@ 2.
And what plac@@ ates German and French voters may en@@ ra@@ ge Poli@@ sh and C@@ ze@@ ch on@@ es.
M@@ aking the case for enlar@@ gement is a challenge to democratic leadership in the whole of Europe.
With his recent sug@@ ges@@ tion that Germany should have a refer@@ endum on enlar@@ ge@@ ment, G@@ ün@@ ter Ver@@ heu@@ gen, the responsible European Commission@@ er, has posed the right question and given the wrong answer@@ .
The question is@@ : Wh@@ y, over more than a decade since the fall of the Ber@@ lin W@@ all, have the political leaders of wes@@ tern Europe made so little serious effect to con@@ vin@@ ce their peop@@ les that exten@@ ding the European Union to the new@@ ly liber@@ ated states of cent@@ r@@ al, sou@@ th@@ -@@ e@@ ast@@ ern and e@@ ast@@ ern Europe is in those peop@@ l@@ es’ own vit@@ al, long-term interest@@ ?
And ho@@ w@@ , bel@@ at@@ ed@@ ly, can that now be don@@ e?
However, refer@@ end@@ ums are not the answer@@ .
We say this not because we don’t trust the people, but because refer@@ end@@ ums in represent@@ ative democracies are instru@@ ments to be used very spar@@ ing@@ ly, on issues that directly aff@@ ect the very core of national interest@@ s, institutions and identi@@ ty.
That is why France had a refer@@ endum on the Ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht treat@@ y, and Den@@ mark (@@ on 2@@ 8 Septem@@ ber@@ ) and Britain (@@ who knows wh@@ en@@ ?@@ ) will have one on jo@@ ining the euro@@ -@@ z@@ one.
But enlar@@ gement is not such an issu@@ e.
Y@@ es, it is vit@@ ally important for all our fut@@ ur@@ es.
But it does not directly imp@@ inge upon the vital interests of any EU nation@@ .
Con@@ tr@@ ary to what the scar@@ em@@ on@@ ger@@ s sug@@ ges@@ t, it will not result in a vast flo@@ od of immig@@ ran@@ ts, or the loss of tens of thousands of job@@ s, let alone any significant further loss of national sovereign@@ ty.
Pop@@ uli@@ sts dramati@@ se the short-term costs of enlar@@ ge@@ ment, while ignor@@ ing the long-term benef@@ its.
The task for democratic leaders is to dramati@@ se the long-term benef@@ its, while plac@@ ing the short-term costs in an hon@@ est but ac@@ cur@@ ate per@@ spec@@ tive.
We have nothing to fear from the fac@@ ts.
Pub@@ li@@ c opinion on either side of the EU’s current e@@ ast@@ ern fron@@ ti@@ er - Europe’s vel@@ v@@ et cur@@ tain - has different concern@@ s, but the two public opini@@ ons are also communic@@ ating v@@ es@@ sel@@ s.
To the wes@@ t, people fear immig@@ ration, job los@@ ses, and having to pay for enlar@@ gement - either direc@@ t@@ ly, in increased contribu@@ tions to the EU budge@@ t, or indi@@ rec@@ t@@ ly, through subsi@@ dies that go@@ , for example, to Poli@@ sh G@@ ali@@ ci@@ a rather than to Sp@@ an@@ ish G@@ ali@@ ci@@ a.
Iron@@ ically, the fear of ‘@@ inst@@ abilit@@ y@@ ’ to Germany’s e@@ ast - which n@@ ou@@ ri@@ shed German support for EU enlar@@ gement - has been reduced by Pol@@ and, the C@@ ze@@ ch Re@@ public and Hung@@ ary jo@@ ining NATO@@ .
Meanwhile, e@@ ast central European markets are so open for w@@ est European expor@@ ters and investors that the wes@@ tern business@@ man can sel@@ fis@@ h@@ ly say ‘@@ why do I need enlar@@ ge@@ ment@@ ?@@ ’
To the e@@ ast@@ , there is di@@ si@@ ll@@ u@@ sion@@ ment with what people see as the bro@@ ken promises of w@@ est European leader@@ s.
There is dis@@ may at the bureauc@@ ratic ri@@ gi@@ di@@ ty and gi@@ gan@@ ti@@ sm of the 8@@ 0@@ ,000 p@@ ages of the acqu@@ is commun@@ au@@ ta@@ i@@ re, which they have to adop@@ t before being let in to the cl@@ ub@@ .
They righ@@ tly consider many of these rules and regul@@ ations to be un@@ du@@ ly protec@@ tive of special interests in@@ side the EU and har@@ m@@ ful to a dynam@@ ic free market economy.
There are, of course, the special wor@@ ries of groups such as the Poli@@ sh far@@ mer@@ s.
And there are broader concerns about giving up some of the sovereign@@ ty these countries have only recently reg@@ ain@@ ed.
There is also a real fear that the price for ent@@ ering the par@@ adi@@ se of Sch@@ en@@ gen@@ land will be that they must make their own e@@ ast@@ ern fron@@ ti@@ ers for@@ ti@@ fied and imp@@ en@@ et@@ ra@@ ble.
This is the last thing Pol@@ and wants to do with Ukra@@ ine, let alone the C@@ ze@@ ch Re@@ public with its former Si@@ am@@ ese tw@@ in, S@@ lo@@ v@@ ak@@ i@@ a, or Hung@@ ary against its own Hung@@ arian min@@ ority in Rom@@ ani@@ a.
One of the difficul@@ ties of making the case for enlar@@ gement is that to sell it in Germany or Au@@ stri@@ a requires the ass@@ ur@@ ance of clos@@ ed, w@@ ater@@ ti@@ ght e@@ ast@@ ern bor@@ ders, while to sell it in Pol@@ and, Hung@@ ary or the C@@ ze@@ ch Re@@ public needs the promise of so@@ ft, open on@@ es.
If not a refer@@ end@@ um, then what is to be don@@ e?
Fir@@ st and for@@ emo@@ st, the EU mu@@ st, at the latest during the S@@ we@@ dis@@ h presiden@@ cy in the first half of 2001, set a defin@@ ite tim@@ et@@ able for the first round of enlar@@ ge@@ ment.
The fact that there was a bin@@ ding tim@@ et@@ able was one of the main reasons why Economic and Monetary Union happened in Janu@@ ary 199@@ 9.
It concent@@ rated min@@ ds like nothing el@@ se.
In@@ spi@@ red by the rec@@ ol@@ lec@@ tion of E@@ M@@ U@@ ’s two target dat@@ es, we suggest that EU leaders should sa@@ y: ‘@@ The first round of enlar@@ gement will happ@@ en, if all the conditions can be met in time, on 1 Janu@@ ary 200@@ 3.
It [@@ start it@@ ali@@ c@@ s@@ ] must [@@ stop it@@ ali@@ c@@ s@@ ] happen by 1 Janu@@ ary 200@@ 5@@ .@@ ’ And, inci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally, that first round must include Pol@@ and, which is the most difficult but also the most important country in the leading group of app@@ lic@@ ant@@ s.
Second, the European Council in Nic@@ e, this Dec@@ em@@ ber, mu@@ st, at long la@@ st, set a clear course for making those institutional reforms without which an EU of 20 and more member states will simply no longer func@@ tion.
Bes@@ ide reforms of Council and Commission@@ , there is a lea@@ p of principle to be made her@@ e.
The Ni@@ ce Council should end@@ or@@ se the principle of ‘@@ enh@@ anced cooper@@ ation@@ ’@@ , so long as such cooperation is flexi@@ ble, transpar@@ ent and genu@@ in@@ el@@ y, at all stag@@ es, open to all member states who wish to jo@@ in.
This opp@@ enn@@ ess is a concern for the app@@ lic@@ ant countries too, who fear that other@@ wise they may be ‘@@ in@@ ’ and yet still ‘@@ out@@ ’@@ .
Thir@@ d, the EU should consi@@ der, in discus@@ sion with all European countries who wish to join it, whether there are not parts of its now complex structu@@ res of cooperation that some of them could join before becoming full members of the EU.
One example would be areas of the Com@@ m@@ on Foreign and Security Poli@@ cy.
(@@ After all, Poli@@ sh and C@@ ze@@ ch troops are already working bes@@ ide British and Itali@@ an ones to re@@ build Kosovo@@ .)
Another could be early acc@@ ession to the plann@@ ed European Char@@ ter of Fund@@ ament@@ al R@@ igh@@ ts.
And it would su@@ rely be f@@ it@@ ting if the pre@@ am@@ ble to that Char@@ ter made exp@@ lic@@ it refer@@ ence to the ide@@ als of the central European revolu@@ tions of 198@@ 9.
F@@ our@@ th, we have to consider how a European per@@ spec@@ tive can be made real to the politicians and public@@ s in the remo@@ ter parts of sou@@ th@@ -@@ e@@ ast@@ ern and e@@ ast@@ ern Europe.
It is one of the ir@@ on@@ ies of the last decade that at the end of it w@@ est European troops and civil serv@@ ants are actually more present in Bosni@@ a and Kosovo than they are in B@@ oh@@ em@@ ia or S@@ il@@ esi@@ a.
The step@@ p@@ ing st@@ ones from military protec@@ tor@@ ate to political integration have to be thought out - and then sp@@ ell@@ ed out.
The EU’s recent message to the people of Serbi@@ a and the other states of former Yu@@ gosla@@ via is a good beginn@@ ing, but more needs to be don@@ e.
And what have we to offer Ukra@@ ine, and other countries to the e@@ ast@@ ?
Finally, and more important than any of these individual step@@ s, the leaders of Europe have to take up the challenge and really start making the case for the larger Europe to their public@@ s, e@@ ast and w@@ est of the vel@@ v@@ et cur@@ tain@@ .
They need to be as serious about this as they have always been about the euro@@ .
A weak euro may be a bl@@ essing in dis@@ gu@@ is@@ e.
A weak Europe is an un@@ mi@@ tig@@ ated cur@@ se.
But who among our leaders will step forward to take up this challen@@ ge@@ ?
The lin@@ ks between states and companies have gra@@ b@@ bed head@@ lin@@ es, most recently in Russia, where President Vladimir Putin seems ob@@ s@@ essed with creating “@@ national ch@@ amp@@ i@@ on@@ s” in the energy and a@@ ero@@ space sector@@ s.
Such efforts seem but a part of a sur@@ ge of protection@@ ism in European political debate about bus@@ ines@@ s, especially when it comes to cros@@ s-@@ border ac@@ qui@@ si@@ tions. 
Ac@@ ross Europe, governments position themselves to be seen as def@@ ending “@@ nation@@ al@@ ” play@@ ers from “@@ foreign@@ ” competi@@ tor@@ s.
“@@ Economic pat@@ rio@@ ti@@ sm@@ ,” the s@@ log@@ an co@@ ined by Franc@@ e’s Prime Minister D@@ om@@ ini@@ que de V@@ il@@ le@@ p@@ in following P@@ ep@@ si@@ Co@@ ’s ru@@ mor@@ ed attempt in Ju@@ ly 2005 to tak@@ e@@ over Dan@@ one, perhaps best enc@@ ap@@ sul@@ ates the political im@@ per@@ ativ@@ e.
Although de V@@ il@@ le@@ p@@ in@@ ’s spe@@ ech@@ es are more fl@@ am@@ bo@@ y@@ ant than those of most political leader@@ s, the underlying senti@@ ment exten@@ ds far beyond Fran@@ ce. 
The same imp@@ ul@@ se appears to be at work behind Ital@@ y’s policy on Aut@@ o@@ stra@@ de, Spain@@ ’s on En@@ des@@ a, Pol@@ and@@ ’s on its banking sector@@ , the former S@@ we@@ dis@@ h Prime Minister@@ ’s on Vol@@ vo@@ , German un@@ e@@ ase about “@@ lo@@ cu@@ st@@ ”@@ -@@ like funds on Deut@@ sche B@@ ör@@ se, or the United King@@ dom@@ ’s ever l@@ ou@@ der defense of the London St@@ o@@ ck Ex@@ chan@@ ge@@ ’s independence from the United Stat@@ es.
The basic belief that under@@ p@@ ins “@@ economic pat@@ rio@@ ti@@ sm@@ ” is that of an ali@@ gn@@ ment of interests between companies considered “@@ nation@@ al@@ ” (@@ most promin@@ ently the largest ones or so-called “@@ ch@@ amp@@ i@@ on@@ s@@ ”@@ ), their national employ@@ e@@ es, and the national commun@@ ity.
According to de V@@ il@@ le@@ p@@ in, “@@ to def@@ end the employ@@ e@@ es’ interests well@@ , we must protect the interests of our compani@@ es@@ .”
He later argued that Dan@@ one should be considered “@@ Fren@@ ch@@ ” because its “@@ mil@@ k collec@@ tion and its water sources are in Franc@@ e.”
But Dan@@ one’s own fil@@ ings indic@@ ate that only 2@@ 2% of its global s@@ ales and less than 1@@ 4% of its global work@@ force are in Fran@@ ce. 
In fact, the lin@@ k between European companies and national communi@@ ties is becoming more ten@@ u@@ ous by the da@@ y.
Res@@ ear@@ ch that I car@@ ried out for Bru@@ e@@ gel sur@@ ve@@ yed the largest 100 li@@ sted companies head@@ quar@@ tered in Europe (@@ rank@@ ed by market capit@@ aliz@@ ation@@ ) and analy@@ zed the geo@@ graph@@ ical distribution of their revenu@@ e, which is increasingly transpar@@ ent since the adop@@ tion of International Financial Re@@ por@@ ting Stand@@ ards (@@ I@@ F@@ R@@ S@@ ) last year.
Europe was divi@@ ded into ei@@ ght broad zon@@ es, com@@ pri@@ sing individual countries like Germany, France, and Ital@@ y, or group@@ ings of smaller countries such as Ben@@ el@@ u@@ x and the Nor@@ di@@ c are@@ a.
The surv@@ ey then calcul@@ ated the share of reven@@ ue ear@@ ned by each company in the zone in which it is head@@ quar@@ tered (or “@@ home bas@@ e@@ ”@@ ), the rest of Europe, and the rest of the world.
Wh@@ ere relevant information for companies was avail@@ able, the compar@@ able distribution of employ@@ e@@ es was also exam@@ in@@ ed.
The results show that the share of the home b@@ ase in total reven@@ ue has be@@ come, on aver@@ age, relatively low@@ : just thre@@ e-@@ ei@@ gh@@ th@@ s, or 3@@ 7@@ .@@ 5@@ %, on average for Europe’s largest 100 compani@@ es.
Of course, this fig@@ ure cover@@ s a wide diversi@@ ty of industri@@ es, and also some geo@@ graph@@ ical differences across the contin@@ ent.
For example, the aver@@ ages for German (@@ 3@@ 4@@ %@@ ) or French (@@ 3@@ 5@@ %@@ ) companies are mark@@ edly lower than for their Sp@@ an@@ ish (@@ 5@@ 6@@ %@@ ) or Itali@@ an (@@ 6@@ 5@@ %@@ ) counter@@ par@@ ts.
But the general tren@@ d is un@@ am@@ big@@ u@@ ous.
For a bro@@ adly represent@@ ative sub@@ -@@ s@@ amp@@ le of 5@@ 5 companies that could be tra@@ ck@@ ed since 199@@ 7, the propor@@ tion of reven@@ ue gener@@ ated in the home region has fallen sharp@@ ly on aver@@ age, from 50@@ .@@ 2% to 3@@ 6@@ .@@ 9@@ %.
For these compani@@ es, s@@ ales to the “@@ rest of Europe@@ ,” which repres@@ ented an average of less than 3@@ 0% of total European s@@ ales in 199@@ 7, ro@@ se above 4@@ 3% in 200@@ 5. 
If the tren@@ d is extra@@ pol@@ ated, the home bas@@ es of Europe’s largest companies will accoun@@ t, on aver@@ age, for less than half of their European revenu@@ e, and less than a third of their global revenu@@ e, before the end of this deca@@ de.
These companies are “@@ Europe@@ ani@@ z@@ ing@@ ” fa@@ st, and the relative wei@@ ght of their home b@@ ase is decl@@ ining even fa@@ st@@ er.
Moreover, this is not just a story about sal@@ es.
The surv@@ ey also measu@@ red the geo@@ graph@@ ical distribution of employ@@ e@@ es relative to the distribution of revenu@@ e.
While the distribution prof@@ il@@ es between employ@@ e@@ es and reven@@ ue could be sharp@@ ly dis@@ similar in some compani@@ es, on average they were almost iden@@ tic@@ al@@ : for a sub@@ -@@ s@@ amp@@ le of 7@@ 3 companies among Europe’s top 100@@ , the home b@@ ase repres@@ ented 3@@ 7% of employ@@ e@@ es and 3@@ 5% of reven@@ ue on average in 200@@ 5, while the rest of Europe accoun@@ ted for 2@@ 9@@ % of employ@@ e@@ es and 2@@ 8% of revenu@@ e.
This stron@@ gly suggests that jobs bro@@ adly “@@ follow@@ ” s@@ ales (or perhaps the other way round@@ ), even though@@ , once again, this is true only on average and not for all compani@@ es.
What are the implic@@ ations for policy@@ mak@@ er@@ s?
P@@ ut si@@ m@@ pl@@ y, the numbers show a growing gap of interests between these so-called “@@ ch@@ amp@@ i@@ on@@ s” and their national home bas@@ es.
For Europe’s government@@ s, fo@@ ster@@ ing ch@@ amp@@ i@@ ons increasingly means providing benefits to non-@@ national custom@@ ers and employ@@ e@@ es – a du@@ bi@@ ous use of taxpay@@ er mone@@ y.
Another consequ@@ ence is that regulatory competition is likely to increase in Europe, as companies are less bound by local interests to keep their head@@ quar@@ ters at “@@ hom@@ e” if the tax or regulatory environment becomes un@@ favor@@ able.
The decision by Dep@@ f@@ a Bank to shift its head@@ quar@@ ters from Wi@@ es@@ b@@ aden to D@@ ub@@ lin in 2002 may be a sign of things to come.
The biggest risk is that the growing dis@@ con@@ n@@ ect between the perc@@ ep@@ tion of “@@ nation@@ al@@ ” companies and the reality of Europe@@ ani@@ zation may lead to spec@@ tac@@ ul@@ arly ill@@ -@@ jud@@ ged policies.
It is high time for business leaders to be more can@@ did about where their real constitu@@ en@@ cies li@@ e, and for national politicians to recognize that they can no longer wi@@ el@@ d control over the gi@@ ants of today’s European bus@@ ines@@ s.
NEW YORK – In@@ creas@@ ing@@ ly, corpor@@ ations are under pres@@ sure, often from activ@@ ist non-@@ government@@ al organiz@@ ations, to take on specific “@@ corporate social responsi@@ bilit@@ y” (@@ C@@ S@@ R@@ ) oblig@@ ations.
But the fact that C@@ S@@ R is being de@@ man@@ ded, and occ@@ a@@ sion@@ ally conc@@ e@@ ded, does not ensure cl@@ arity about either its ration@@ ale or the ways in which it should be under@@ tak@@ en.
C@@ S@@ R can be divi@@ ded into two cat@@ eg@@ ori@@ es: what corpor@@ ations should do (@@ say, contribute to a wom@@ en’s rights NG@@ O or build a vil@@ lage school@@ ) and what they should not do (@@ say, d@@ um@@ p mer@@ cur@@ y into ri@@ vers or bur@@ y ha@@ z@@ ard@@ ous materi@@ als in land@@ fill@@ s@@ ).
The lat@@ ter is whol@@ ly conventional and subject to regulation (and recently to questions about how corpor@@ ations should be@@ have when there are no ho@@ st-@@ country regul@@ ations@@ ).
But are C@@ S@@ R oblig@@ ations really good practic@@ e?
Mil@@ ton Fried@@ man and other critic@@ s often asked if it was the business of busin@@ esses to practi@@ ce corporate al@@ tru@@ ism.
Pri@@ or to the rise of the corpor@@ ation, there were mainly family firm@@ s, such as the Ro@@ th@@ sch@@ il@@ ds.
When they made mone@@ y, it acc@@ ru@@ ed princip@@ ally to the family itself.
Al@@ tru@@ ism, where it exist@@ ed, also was under@@ taken by the fam@@ il@@ y, which decided how and on what to spend its mone@@ y.
W@@ he@@ ther the fir@@ m or its sharehol@@ ders and other stak@@ ehol@@ ders spent the money was bes@@ ide the poin@@ t.
With the rise of the business corpor@@ ation, large family firms have generally dis@@ appear@@ ed.
But that does not mean that a corpor@@ ation is the right enti@@ ty to eng@@ age in al@@ tru@@ ism – though its various stak@@ ehol@@ ders ob@@ viously can spend any por@@ tion of the income they ear@@ n from the corpor@@ ation and other sources in al@@ tru@@ is@@ tic way@@ s.
Inste@@ ad of C@@ S@@ R@@ , we should have P@@ S@@ R (@@ personal social responsi@@ bilit@@ y@@ ).
One can also argue for P@@ S@@ R on the ground@@ s that as@@ king for C@@ S@@ R becomes a way of “@@ pass@@ ing the bu@@ ck@@ ” – ev@@ ad@@ ing personal responsibility for doing go@@ od.
This is the f@@ li@@ p side of blam@@ ing corpor@@ ations for everything from o@@ bes@@ ity to sc@@ al@@ ding from sp@@ ill@@ ed co@@ ff@@ e@@ e – both the subject of law@@ su@@ its in recent years.
There is also an added advantage in re@@ plac@@ ing C@@ S@@ R with P@@ S@@ R@@ : there is vir@@ tu@@ e in diversi@@ ty of approach@@ es to al@@ tru@@ ism.
Cha@@ ir@@ man Ma@@ o wanted a hund@@ red flo@@ wer@@ s to blo@@ om@@ , but only so that he could cut them all off at their roo@@ ts.
But P@@ S@@ R is more like President George H@@ .@@ W. Bush’s met@@ ap@@ h@@ or of a “@@ thous@@ and points of ligh@@ t@@ .”
Moreover, it is hard to see how a corpor@@ ation@@ ’s stak@@ ehol@@ ders can always ar@@ ri@@ ve democrati@@ cally at a common position on how the corpor@@ ation should eng@@ age in social responsibility on their be@@ hal@@ f.
E@@ ach will consider his or her C@@ S@@ R view the bes@@ t.
But there are strong argum@@ ents in favor of C@@ S@@ R as well.
First, the political reality is that society treat@@ s corpor@@ ations as if they were person@@ s, which is often also a legal reality for many pur@@ pos@@ es.
Soci@@ ety increasingly demands that these “@@ corporate citiz@@ ens@@ ” be al@@ tru@@ istic@@ , just as people ar@@ e.
Given this re@@ ality, corpor@@ ations want to give simply because it is expected of them.
Such C@@ S@@ R buil@@ ds the firm@@ ’s ima@@ ge as a “@@ good@@ ” corpor@@ ation, just as giving by Bill G@@ ates and War@@ ren Bu@@ ff@@ et buil@@ ds their ima@@ ge as “@@ good@@ ” billi@@ on@@ ai@@ res@@ .
Second, many corpor@@ ations view C@@ S@@ R as an effective def@@ ensive strategy against powerful activ@@ ist NG@@ O@@ s (@@ such as Green@@ peac@@ e) that have taken to using on@@ line ag@@ it@@ ation, bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt@@ s, and other means to “@@ bl@@ ack@@ ma@@ il@@ ” targe@@ ted corpor@@ ations into acc@@ ed@@ ing to the activi@@ st@@ s’ dem@@ and@@ s.
The more C@@ S@@ R a company can point to@@ , the less such efforts will succe@@ ed – or even be moun@@ ted.
Consider the contra@@ sting experi@@ ences of C@@ ok@@ e and P@@ ep@@ si@@ .
C@@ ok@@ e has been targe@@ ted by NG@@ O@@ s for al@@ leg@@ ed l@@ ap@@ ses in labor and environmental standard@@ s.
By contrast, P@@ ep@@ si@@ , which once te@@ am@@ ed up with A@@ T@@ &amp@@ ;@@ T and the C@@ I@@ A to o@@ ust President Sal@@ v@@ ad@@ or All@@ ende in Chi@@ le, sm@@ ells like a ro@@ se nowad@@ ay@@ s, because it has distri@@ but@@ ed C@@ S@@ R lar@@ ges@@ se to several causes that influ@@ ential NG@@ O@@ s emb@@ rac@@ e.
That is a lesson that W@@ al-@@ Mar@@ t has since lear@@ n@@ ed.
In 200@@ 5, the Ser@@ vice Emp@@ loy@@ e@@ es’ International Union (@@ S@@ E@@ I@@ U@@ ) created W@@ al-@@ Mar@@ t W@@ at@@ ch, with an annual budget of $@@ 5 milli@@ on.
The pur@@ pose was to make W@@ al-@@ Mar@@ t a “@@ better employ@@ er, neighbor@@ , and corporate citiz@@ en@@ ,” and W@@ al-@@ Mar@@ t eventually capit@@ ul@@ ated on some of the S@@ E@@ I@@ U@@ ’s specific demands as well.
Finally, C@@ S@@ R can be simply a matter of ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ s@@ ing.
In this case, the choice of C@@ S@@ R spending is focused directly on gener@@ ating added revenu@@ e, much like ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ s@@ ing, and is aimed at s@@ ales much the way ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing is.
A ben@@ ig@@ n example is A@@ did@@ as@@ ’s sp@@ on@@ sor@@ ship of ten@@ nis to@@ ur@@ n@@ ament@@ s.
A ma@@ lig@@ n example is Ph@@ ili@@ p Mor@@ ris@@ ’s don@@ ation of money to mus@@ e@@ um@@ s, symp@@ hon@@ y or@@ ch@@ est@@ ra@@ s, and oper@@ a hous@@ es, cy@@ ni@@ cally aimed at bu@@ ying off arti@@ sts who might other@@ wise work to ban ci@@ gar@@ ett@@ es.
All these ration@@ ales for C@@ S@@ R suggest that it should be left to each corpor@@ ation to determin@@ e, just as P@@ S@@ R lea@@ ves al@@ tru@@ ism to each individu@@ al@@ ’s con@@ science and sense of what needs sup@@ port@@ ing.
The attempt by some NG@@ O@@ s and activi@@ sts to impose a stra@@ it@@ j@@ ack@@ et on C@@ S@@ R@@ , reflec@@ ting their priori@@ ties, is mis@@ gu@@ ided and must be rejec@@ ted.
Instead, the model should be former United Nations Secretary General K@@ of@@ i Ann@@ an’s initi@@ ative, the Global Com@@ p@@ ac@@ t.
What Ann@@ an has done is to em@@ bra@@ ce ten wi@@ de-@@ ran@@ ging gu@@ iding principles while leaving sig@@ nat@@ ory corpor@@ ations free to choose that which they wish to support ac@@ ti@@ vel@@ y.
In recent week@@ s, leaders of various opposition organizations in Georgi@@ a, such as Anti@@ sor@@ os and F@@ air@@ n@@ ess, have been j@@ ail@@ ed on un@@ fair acc@@ us@@ ations of p@@ lo@@ t@@ ting a cou@@ p on be@@ half of Russia.
But the wa@@ ve of political repres@@ sion merely reflects President Mik@@ ha@@ il Sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vili@@ ’s des@@ per@@ ate effort to cl@@ ing to power.
With popular dis@@ sent growing and opposition forces strength@@ en@@ ing, the authorities have sought to contro@@ ll non-@@ government@@ al organizations (@@ NG@@ O@@ s) and strengthen the security forc@@ es.
But this will only make mass protests inevit@@ able, ultimately je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zing the democratic transition in Georgi@@ a that Sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i claims to repres@@ ent.
Sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i se@@ es a “@@ Mosco@@ w hand@@ ” in every challenge to his author@@ ity, which could be expla@@ ined by his government’s close alliance with the United Stat@@ es.
But the people ro@@ unded up in the latest ra@@ id against the opposition were origin@@ ally im@@ prison@@ ed by E@@ du@@ ard Sh@@ ev@@ ar@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ e’s government, which Sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i helped de@@ pose in Georgi@@ a’s sup@@ pos@@ edly democratic “@@ R@@ ose revolution@@ ” in 200@@ 3.
The latest events clearly indic@@ ate that a c@@ z@@ ar@@ ist ment@@ ality survi@@ ved the revolu@@ tion, reflec@@ ted in a B@@ y@@ z@@ ant@@ ine model of political power — an em@@ per@@ or and his cour@@ t — that has as its main v@@ eh@@ ic@@ le largely un@@ constra@@ ined presidential author@@ ity.
Be@@ fore the security forces targe@@ ted the opposition blo@@ c that I repres@@ ent, suppor@@ ters of educ@@ ational reforms were pro@@ secu@@ ted, while most of the press is under the influence of the government.
Sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i claims that the opposition forces that I repres@@ ent op@@ pose Western valu@@ es.
But we advoc@@ ate parliament@@ ar@@ ism – genu@@ ine separ@@ ation of execu@@ tive and legisl@@ ative power – in Georgi@@ a.
And, in suppor@@ ting the Western model of parliament@@ ari@@ an@@ sm@@ , we are on the side of Georgi@@ a, not Russia.
It is st@@ range that Sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vili@@ , a gradu@@ ate of Col@@ umbi@@ a La@@ w Scho@@ ol@@ , fail@@ s to see the di@@ spar@@ ity between his own democratic rhetor@@ ic and auto@@ c@@ ratic ac@@ tions.
Thus, those of us who value Georgi@@ a’s historical ties with Russia are c@@ alle@@ d, at bes@@ t, “@@ arch@@ a@@ ist@@ s@@ ,” and at worst “@@ enem@@ ies of Georgi@@ an indepen@@ den@@ c@@ e@@ ,” as if Georgi@@ a would become a Russian col@@ ony if we ever came to power.
But what separ@@ ates us from Sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i is that we understand that history, geo@@ graph@@ y, and economics dict@@ ate close ties to Russia.
We simply see no contra@@ dic@@ tion between that stance and support for Western valu@@ es.
Indeed, even Russia, with all its im@@ perf@@ ec@@ tions, cannot be said to op@@ pose Western valu@@ es.
The un@@ fortun@@ ate par@@ ad@@ o@@ x in Georgi@@ a – and else@@ where in the post-@@ Soviet world – is that self-@@ ser@@ ving pro-@@ Western rhetor@@ ic has often led democratic values to be sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed in favor of a new dictator@@ ship.
When the West ac@@ tively suppor@@ ts popular revolu@@ tions, as in Georgi@@ a and Ukra@@ ine, the new@@ ly established power reli@@ es on democratic s@@ lo@@ gan@@ s, not democratic behavi@@ or.
Sh@@ ev@@ ard@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ e, too, was initi@@ ally viewed as a symbo@@ l of post-@@ Soviet Georgi@@ an democracy.
As a government minister in 199@@ 3, however, I was already hear@@ ing C@@ I@@ A officials ex@@ press concern that a “@@ M@@ af@@ ia stat@@ e” was being created inste@@ ad.
Fir@@ st with Sh@@ ev@@ ar@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ e, and now with Sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vili@@ , popular di@@ si@@ ll@@ u@@ sion@@ ment reflects not rejec@@ tion of democracy, but fru@@ stration with its continuing absen@@ ce.
Sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i is evi@@ d@@ ently mes@@ m@@ eri@@ zed by the US, and the West in gener@@ al, but what is the point if there is no independent and democratic political process in Georgi@@ a toda@@ y?
And wh@@ y, then, is sustain@@ ing close ties to the US so desi@@ ra@@ ble, while ref@@ using to dis@@ mis@@ s Russia as a partn@@ er is regar@@ ded as being an ag@@ ent of the Krem@@ lin@@ ?
Is the US, in contra@@ st to Russia, by defin@@ ition hon@@ es@@ t, in@@ no@@ cent@@ , and high-@@ min@@ de@@ d@@ ?
There should be no place for such un@@ fortun@@ ate dou@@ ble standard@@ s.
Re@@ g@@ ardless of what the Sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i government claims about his oppon@@ ents, our political ori@@ ent@@ ation is not pro-@@ Russi@@ an, but pro-@@ Georgi@@ an.
We believe that Georgi@@ a should pursue its own interest@@ s, which it may share with Europe, Russia, or the US, but which are non@@ eth@@ eless our ow@@ n.
We have no interest in merely ex@@ ec@@ ut@@ ing US policy, or in bas@@ ing Georgi@@ a’s foreign and domestic policy sol@@ ely on dist@@ anc@@ ing the country from Russia, as Sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i has don@@ e.
Thus, pro-@@ Georgi@@ an politics should not coun@@ ten@@ ance nation@@ alism.
N@@ ow@@ ad@@ ay@@ s, some of our politicians have emb@@ rac@@ ed the s@@ log@@ an “@@ Georgi@@ a for Georgi@@ ans@@ .”
But nation@@ alism suggests the lack of a co@@ her@@ ent conc@@ ep@@ tion of Georgi@@ a’s interest@@ s.
Georgi@@ a’s tradi@@ tion as a mul@@ tin@@ ation@@ al, toler@@ ant state, which has been weak@@ ened in the last 15 years, must be rein@@ vi@@ g@@ or@@ ated, because we have no need for enem@@ ies against which to defin@@ e our@@ sel@@ ves.
A strong relationship with Russia need not come at the exp@@ ense of relations with America and the Wes@@ t, and vice ver@@ sa@@ .
Georgi@@ a should be neither pro-@@ Russian nor pro-@@ Americ@@ an.
It is a sm@@ all, poor country that des@@ per@@ ately needs stability and economic development.
Its model should not be Palest@@ ine and permanent batt@@ le, but S@@ wi@@ tz@@ er@@ land and permanent prosper@@ ity.
“@@ We are all Americ@@ ans@@ ,” w@@ ro@@ te L@@ e Mon@@ de on September 1@@ 2, 200@@ 1@@ . @@ And so it was with most people in the Muslim world, who were as app@@ all@@ ed as anyone el@@ se at the car@@ n@@ age of the terrorist attacks on Washington and New Yor@@ k.
Indeed, when America respon@@ ded to the attack@@ s, almost no one mo@@ ur@@ ned the fall of the Tali@@ b@@ an, who were univers@@ ally condem@@ ned for their fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism.
This un@@ anim@@ ity of opinion no longer exist@@ s.
In the five years since the attack@@ s, two au@@ di@@ ences for the so-called “@@ war on terror@@ ” have emer@@ ge@@ d.
Indeed, as the “@@ war@@ ” progres@@ s@@ ed, the au@@ di@@ ence clos@@ est to the action began to see the emerging comb@@ at in a way that was di@@ am@@ et@@ ri@@ cally op@@ posed to that of the United States and the Wes@@ t.
To the US administ@@ ration, every act in the dra@@ ma of the war on ter@@ ror was seen as dis@@ cre@@ te and self-@@ contain@@ ed@@ : Afghanistan, Iraq, Palest@@ ine, and Hez@@ bollah in Leban@@ on.
The Bush administ@@ ration, having proc@@ la@@ im@@ ed a war on terror@@ , inv@@ aded and occup@@ ied countries, and yet failed to see that these events were being lin@@ ked in the ey@@ es of people in the region.
G@@ lu@@ ed to Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era and other Arab sat@@ el@@ li@@ te chan@@ n@@ el@@ s, the various batt@@ les of the “@@ war on terror@@ ” came to be viewed as a single ch@@ ain of events in a gr@@ and p@@ lot against Islam@@ .
Wor@@ se ye@@ t, America wa@@ ved the b@@ ann@@ er of democracy as it pro@@ sec@@ uted its war@@ s@@ . @@ But hop@@ es for democracy, be it sec@@ ular or Islam@@ ist, for the people concerned have been bu@@ ried in the ru@@ b@@ ble and car@@ n@@ age of B@@ ag@@ h@@ d@@ ad, Bei@@ ru@@ t, and K@@ and@@ ah@@ ar.
Many Muslims understand – as well as anyone in the Wes@@ t, and in the same terms – the underlying causes of the alien@@ ation that anim@@ ates Islamic radic@@ alism and viol@@ enc@@ e@@ . @@ They know that the ri@@ gi@@ d dictator@@ ships of the region have par@@ aly@@ zed their popul@@ ations@@ . @@ Only those consum@@ ed by the fi@@ res of their ra@@ ge seem able to mel@@ t the sh@@ ac@@ kl@@ es of these authoritarian socie@@ ties.

But the price of es@@ cap@@ e is a kind of de@@ form@@ ation.
E@@ m@@ bit@@ ter@@ ed, fan@@ ati@@ c@@ al, ven@@ gef@@ ul@@ : those who re@@ bel against the status qu@@ o enter the wider world seeking ret@@ ali@@ ation, not just against the regimes that de@@ form@@ ed them, but against the Wes@@ t, which pro@@ pped up the region’s author@@ it@@ ari@@ ans in the interest of “@@ stabilit@@ y@@ .”
Many Muslims also understand that the problem of Palest@@ ine, un@@ sol@@ ved for three gener@@ ations, goes beyond the suff@@ ering of the Palestinian peop@@ le@@ . @@ They know that the region’s dict@@ ators have used Palest@@ ine to justi@@ fy their mis@@ rule and to avoid political and economic liber@@ aliz@@ ation.
So when America called for democracy, the hear@@ ts of many in the region so@@ ared with the hope that reform would come at la@@ st@@ . @@ But America, as so many times befor@@ e, let them dow@@ n.
As people at last began to hope for more liberal and dec@@ ent socie@@ ties, the US continued to end@@ or@@ se the regimes that were repres@@ sing them@@ . @@ America simply could not ad@@ here to its own democrac@@ y-@@ promo@@ tion s@@ cri@@ p@@ t.
After the ou@@ ster of the Taliban in Afghanistan, the US turned its si@@ gh@@ ts on the sec@@ ular dictator@@ ship of Saddam Hus@@ sein@@ ’s Iraq@@ . @@ Inste@@ ad of encoura@@ ging reform of the Saudi@@ /@@ W@@ ah@@ hab@@ i regime – the system that sp@@ aw@@ ned 15 of the 1@@ 9 hi@@ j@@ ack@@ ers in the 9@@ /@@ 11 attacks – the average Muslim saw America as w@@ aging war on a regime that had nothing to do with that cri@@ me.
Many Muslims ac@@ qui@@ es@@ c@@ ed in this de@@ vi@@ ation, view@@ ing the inv@@ asion of Iraq as part of the pass@@ ing of dictator@@ ship and the coming of democrac@@ y@@ . @@ But the blo@@ od@@ stain@@ ed sh@@ am@@ bl@@ es of the US occup@@ ation led America to aband@@ on the qu@@ est for democracy.
The deep@@ er America s@@ ank into the Iraqi qu@@ ag@@ mi@@ re, the more the US began to turn a blin@@ d ey@@ e to the region’s survi@@ ving dictator@@ s, particularly those in Saudi Arabi@@ a, Syri@@ a, Egyp@@ t, and Pakist@@ an.
Indeed, the last thing the region’s dict@@ ators wanted to see was a democratic Iraq.
Al@@ most from the moment of Sad@@ dam@@ ’s fall@@ , Saudi@@ /@@ W@@ ah@@ hab@@ i ji@@ ha@@ di@@ s p@@ ou@@ red into Iraq almost un@@ im@@ pe@@ ded.
Wor@@ se ye@@ t, the Muslims who supported the project to democrati@@ ze Iraq widely susp@@ ect that the Sun@@ ni resist@@ ance that inc@@ ited the Iraqi civil war has been financ@@ ed by Saudi oil mone@@ y.
(@@ Terror@@ ism also kept Iraqi oil from becoming a serious challen@@ ger to Saudi Arabi@@ a@@ .)
So the effort to democrati@@ ze Iraq – indeed, the entire American project to democrati@@ ze the region – has fallen under deep susp@@ ici@@ on by even the most moderate of Muslim@@ s.
America, they believ@@ e, only wants a democracy that su@@ its its interest@@ s.
If Palestinians fre@@ ely vote for Ham@@ as, their choice is ac@@ tively op@@ pos@@ ed.
Leban@@ on’s “@@ C@@ ed@@ ar Revolu@@ tion@@ ,” which g@@ al@@ v@@ ani@@ zed the West in the same way as Ukra@@ ine@@ ’s O@@ range Revolu@@ tion, has been systemati@@ cally undermin@@ ed.
With democracy in most of the region still a long way off – indeed, perhaps a more dist@@ ant prospect now than five years ago – US Secretary of State Con@@ d@@ ol@@ ee@@ zz@@ a Ri@@ ce repe@@ ats her man@@ tr@@ a that the de@@ ad civili@@ ans of Bei@@ ru@@ t, S@@ id@@ on, T@@ y@@ re, and Gaza repres@@ ent the “@@ bir@@ th p@@ ang@@ s” of a new Middle East@@ .
But until the West st@@ ops regar@@ ding de@@ ad bab@@ ies as political pro@@ p@@ s, we cannot understand how the Muslim world percei@@ ves all that has happened since September 1@@ 1, 200@@ 1.
Only then will we understand why the uni@@ fied view of five years ago has fra@@ c@@ tured so viol@@ ent@@ ly.
